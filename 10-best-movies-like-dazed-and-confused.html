Ben Affleck, Milla Jovovich, Cole Hauser, Parker Posey, Adam Goldberg, and Matthew McConaughey are just some of the names that featured in the film, which follows a number of high schoolers on their last day of school in Austin, Texas. Without a doubt one of the most iconic teen films of all time, it was a bit of a box office flop when it came out, but is now (rightly) highly regarded thanks to its epic soundtrack, great acting, and playful but loose plot that still manages to be glued together in a way that’s entertaining. If you love this 1993 classic and want to see more films like it, then read ahead for our guide to the 10 best movies like Dazed and Confused.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-ferris-bueller-s-day-off data-injectable=false>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=886 data-current-count=1186 data-injectable=true>Whenever people think they don’t like Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, it’s often because they’ve seen so many films that took from it that they think it’s stale, when in reality it is the gold standard for high school films. Matthew Broderick stars as the titular Ferris, a popular slacker who hates school, often buts heads with his principal (Alan Ruck), and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">breaks the fourth wall</a> to talk to the audience. The film follows Ferris, his best friend, and his girlfriend as they skip classes for the day to go galiavanting around Chicago, ending up at a baseball game and a huge parade, all while their principal tries to catch them in the act. Smart, funny, and oh so relatable, this definitely has that end of high school, anything is possible feel that makes Dazed such a nostalgic watch, even if you grew up a million miles from American high school culture.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>American Graffiti</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=766 data-current-count=1066 data-injectable=true>Like Dazed, this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cheaply made classic coming-of-age movie</a> has a stellar cast of actors, directors, and producers, including George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola, Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, and Harrison Ford. It has a vignette structure and also follows a group of teenagers, although they live in Modesto, California, not Austin. The movie delves into the history of rock-n-roll and car-cruising culture via its ensemble cast, and takes place over the course of a single night. We see the teens struggling with big decisions in their lives, whether it’s going to college or racing for one last time. Full of wistful romance, plenty of jokes, and a few dramatic twists, this epic film is one for the ages, and will definitely remind fans of Dazed and Confused.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=570 data-current-count=870 data-injectable=true>Another high school coming-of-age film, Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a little bit of a raunchy stoner comedy like Dazed and Confused, but with a bit more of a focus on story than the latter. It follows multiple characters whose plotlines all tie in together as they deal with sex, growing up, and angry teachers, and in parts is embarrassingly realistic when it comes to showing off the nature of being young, horny, and full of unrequited love. Brilliantly witty in some scenes and dumb in all the right ways in others, fans of Dazed will certainly enjoy this watch.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Everybody Wants Some!!</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=674 data-current-count=974 data-injectable=true>Seen by many as the spiritual successor to Dazed and Confused as it was written and directed by the same director (Richard Linklater), this teen comedy chronicles a group of college baseball players as they navigate their freshman year of college. Full of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">partying, drug taking, and a surprising amount of genuinely sweet romance</a>, Everybody Wants Some!! has the same vibe as Dazed and could easily be watched back to back with the 1993 ensemble comedy. With that said, it has more of a linear plot than Dazed, although is a bit meandering in the same fun way. Regardless of its similarities to Linklater’s most famous work, it’s worth watching on its own merits.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Almost Famous</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=769 data-current-count=1069 data-injectable=true>A box office bomb that also managed to garner multiple award nominations (as well as an Oscar for best original screenplay), Almost Famous is a cult classic of the best kind (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and soon to be musical</a>). The film follows the adventures of a teen journalist as he swindles his way into going on tour with a famous fictional rock band named Stillwater, so he can write an article for Rolling Stone. Although the plot of the film is winding, like Dazed it’s real charm comes from the character work and humor, as well as scenes that aren’t integral to the plot but are to seeing the on screen presences grow. The whole thing feels very organic and you end up rooting for almost everyone, even as they act villainous. A must-watch for any fan of Dazed and Confused.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Breakfast Club</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=738 data-current-count=1038 data-injectable=true>What is there to say about The Breakfast Club that hasn’t already been said? <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Iconic doesn’t even begin to cover this film</a>, which has been copied, parodied, and everything in between since its release in 1985. Director John Hughes probably didn’t know just what lightning was in his hands when he made this movie about five students who have to spend a Saturday in detention for various reasons. As we learn about each of the kids and their lives, we see why they are the way they are, and get drawn more and more into their world. It might be a bit predictable, but that doesn’t matter: this coming-of-age film is truly brilliant, and undoubtedly would have influenced Linklater as he made Dazed a few years later.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Empire Records</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=590 data-current-count=890 data-injectable=true>An ensemble cast mostly playing teens, a great soundtrack, and lots of young romance and weed smoking: no, not Dazed and Confused, but Empire Records. This classic about a group of record store employees trying to save their shop from being turned into a chain covers a lot of the same beats as the famous film set in Austin, but the musical setting gives it a whole different dimension. Not quite as good as many of the others on this list, it definitely still has a similar vibe to them given its themes and plotline. Nowadays, it’s most notable for a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">joke holiday that it inspired</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Superbad</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=648 data-current-count=948 data-injectable=true>Last day of school? A big party? Older, creepier characters trying to get in on the teen action? Superbad could be seen as an updated version of Dazed and Confused in more ways than one, although it has to be said the humor is a little more grossout in the Jonah Hill film than it is in the 90s classic. Superbad follows two best friends as they seek to lose their virginity at a party hosted by a popular classmate, only to end up on a bit of a wild night out that includes a shootout and a big, blowout argument between the pair. A modern-day classic of the best kind, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Superbad was an instant hit</a>, and watching it back it’s easy to see why.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>American Pie</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=603 data-current-count=903 data-injectable=true>Soundtracks can wrap you in a web of nostalgia, and American Pie (and its sequel) has that vibe, with its pop-punk backing dropping viewers right into the late nineties and early oughts just like Dazed does for its setting. Raunchy, funny, and a very much not politically correct, American Pie is about a group of high school seniors eager to have sex before they graduate, and the increasingly hilarious and bizarre ways they go about trying to achieve that aim. A brilliant watch, complete with the legendary Jennifer Coolidge at her best, there’s a reason why this film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spawned so many sequels</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Friday</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=689 data-current-count=989 data-injectable=false>The only film on this list that isn’t a coming-of-age movie, Friday makes it because of its offbeat humor that’s incredibly similar to Dazed and Confused, and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">importance of weed culture</a> in the film’s DNA. The buddy comedy wanted to take a lighter look at hood life without sanding down its edges too much, and it succeeds at this brilliantly. Friday follows the recently unemployed Craig and his stoner pal Smokey, who end up owing a local dealer money and have to spend the day scrabbling around to try and find it. Like Dazed, Friday is more about transporting you to a place and time than following a plot with baited breath, and is generally just a great watch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoaGllkprAtXnMqK2inaNiuaq3xGabmrKVmXqiusNmmqimlqrAprCO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-best-movies-like-dazed-and-confused.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-best-movies-like-dazed-and-confused.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-best-movies-like-dazed-and-confused.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-best-movies-like-dazed-and-confused.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-best-movies-like-dazed-and-confused.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-best-movies-like-dazed-and-confused.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./anandtech-webcast-live-from-sc12-ask-your-intel-ssd-dc-s3700-questions-here.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./anandtech-webcast-live-from-sc12-ask-your-intel-ssd-dc-s3700-questions-here.html>Ask Your Intel SSD DC S3700 Questions Here</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./where-is-jerrins-son.html>Where is Jerrins son?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./where-is-jerrins-son.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
