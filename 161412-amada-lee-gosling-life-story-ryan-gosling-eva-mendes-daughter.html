Amada Lee Gosling's age as of June 2023 is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">seven</a> years.</p><h3>Amada Lee Gosling's parents</h3><p class=align-left>Her parents are iconic actors Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes. They sparked dating rumors in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2011 </a>when filming the film, <i>The Place Beyond the Pines</i>, where they coincidentally played a couple with an infant son. Their on-screen chemistry would later translate into their personal lives.</p><h3>What is the age difference between Eva Mendes and Ryan Gosling?</h3><p class=align-left>Ryan was born on 12 November 1980, while Mendes was born on 5 March 1974. That makes the <a href=#>actress </a>older than her partner by six years.</p><h3>Did Eva and Ryan split?</h3><p class=align-left>No, they did not. The lovebirds have always maintained an extremely private relationship and are drama-free, which has led to allegations that the two might no longer be an item.</p><h3>Sibling</h3><p class=align-left>She has one elder sister named Esmeralda Amada Gosling, born on 12 September 2014. Surprisingly, her middle name is Lee's first name. Eva revealed that she and Ryan had a few <a href=#>girl name</a> options. However, they kept returning to Amada, her grandmother's name and eventually settled on it.</p><h3>Is Amada Lee Gosling adopted?</h3><p class=align-left>No, she is not. There are allegations about Lee being adopted because her mother kept her <a href=#>pregnancy</a> a secret. Moreover, Eva Mendes kept both pregnancies a secret for several months.</p><p class=align-left>She revealed that she never wanted anyone besides her close friends and family to know more than they had to. Moreover, Ryan has always kept his family life private.</p><h3>How old was Eva Mendes when she had her child?</h3><p class=align-left>She had her first child when she was <a id="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/pictures/40-plus-and-pregnant-201086/#:~:text=Eva%20Mendes,before%20at%20times%2C%20but%20no." href=# rel="nofollow noopener">40</a> and her second born when she was 42.</p><h3>Amada Lee Gosling's pictures</h3><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, these are hard to find online because her parents never share her or her sister's pictures. Eva once revealed that she maintains her children's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">privacy</a> by not posting their photos on social media.</p><p class=align-left>She explained that she would talk about them but with limits. She added that she would only share their pictures once they were old enough to consent.</p><h3>Amada Lee Gosling and Ryan Gosling's relationship</h3><p class=align-left>The two appear to have a solid father-daughter relationship from what the actor has shared about his daughter. In the past, he has revealed how <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">unimpressed</a> Amada was with some of the art in the Louvre. He hilariously shared how his daughter turned to him after they got to the "Mona Lisa" <a href=#>painting</a> and gave him two thumbs down.</p><h3>What is Ryan Gosling's net worth?</h3><p class=align-left>He has a net worth of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$70 million</a>, while his partner Eva Mendes has a net worth of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$20 million</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Amada Lee Gosling is the second daughter of Hollywood veteran couple Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes.
