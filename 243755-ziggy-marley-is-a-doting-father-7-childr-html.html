Ziggy<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.fatherly.com/play/ziggy-marley-interview-fatherhood/> shared</a>:</p><p class=dh>"In the hospital (..) he said, ‘What’s up, young bub? I have a song for you.’ (...) ‘On your way up, take me up. On your way down, don’t let me down.’"</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>YOUNG FATHER</strong></p><p class=dh>Ziggy became a father at the age of 21 and welcomed his oldest son, singer-songwriter Bombaata, now 31, with longtime love Lorraine Bogle. The couple welcomed their second child together, daughter Justice, in 1991.</p><p class=dh>The couple separated, and Ziggy became involved in a relationship with Carlene Samuels, with whom he welcomed another, Zuri, now 25, who has inherited the family's musical talent.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>LOVE AND MARRIAGE</strong></p><p class=dh>"I had one of my kids with me at the time and I was feeding them and she made a remark like, 'That's so cute.'

He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/ziggy-marley-is-unfazed-by-fatherhood-im-not-the-frazzled-one/>joked</a>:</p><p class=dh>“My wife [Orly] is the frazzled one; I’m not the frazzled one.”</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>DISCIPLINE AND LOVE</strong></p><p class=dh>That, however, doesn't mean that the Marley kids have a free pass on unruly or rude behavior.

The Marley kids practice martial arts and enjoy outdoor activities. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/ziggy-marley-is-unfazed-by-fatherhood-im-not-the-frazzled-one/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>“When it’s warm out, we find scrap pieces of wood and build things. It’s kind of like an adventure outside. We have fun with whatever.”</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>VEGETARIAN</strong></p><p class=dh>Ziggy is a vegetarian, but that doesn't mean that the kids don't get to munch down on hamburgers, pizza, and hotdogs. The musician admits that although he keeps the family diet healthy, he does allow the occasional treat.</p><p class=dh>Cooking is<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/ziggy-marley-kids-playing-uno-parenting-exclusive/> another shared family activity</a>, and ZIggy revealed that he often prepares the family meals.

The musician revealed that the idea is to give the kids living through the difficult restrictions of quarantine a lift.</p><p class=dh>The new album, "More Family Time," features collaborations with Ziggy's pals Alanis Morisette, Sheryl Crow, Busta Rhymes, Tom Morello, and Ben Harper. Ziggy credits the album's inspiration to his youngest son, Isaiah.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtrbG9lanq7tcagsGalkae5psWMoqpmmV2ZvLW1zaBkn5mknbKzeZZmmqGhnJm%2Fb7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f243755-ziggy-marley-is-a-doting-father-7-childr-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f243755-ziggy-marley-is-a-doting-father-7-childr-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f243755-ziggy-marley-is-a-doting-father-7-childr-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f243755-ziggy-marley-is-a-doting-father-7-childr-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f243755-ziggy-marley-is-a-doting-father-7-childr-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f243755-ziggy-marley-is-a-doting-father-7-childr-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./michelle-graci-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./michelle-graci-net-worth.html>Michelle Graci Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-untold-truth-of-sophia-loren.html>The Untold Truth Of Sophia Loren</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-untold-truth-of-sophia-loren.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
