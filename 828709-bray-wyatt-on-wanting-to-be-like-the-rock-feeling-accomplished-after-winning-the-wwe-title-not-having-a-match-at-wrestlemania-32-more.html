Below are a few of the highlights from the podcast:</p><p>On Whether or Not it Has Hit Him on His Successful 2017:</p><p>I think people expected it of me a long time ago, and I definitely expected it of myself. It was everything that I wanted to obtain while I was here. The tag team titles was a beautiful thing because it’ll go down as me and Randy winning them. Me and Randy were pretty unstoppable at the time. It was a shame that if we were still on the same page we would still have them right now; just decorate the whole place with titles. This is a huge deal for me; it’s made my life’s work complete.</p><p>On Whether or Not He Has Accomplished Everything He Wanted in Wrestling After Winning the Title:</p><p>No, it has not. There has a lot of stuff I have to do. This [winning the WWE Championship] was just something that will cement me forever and something special, my body is ready to roll for another 15 years. I’m not looking at stopping at any point. I have a lot to do, a lot that I want to achieve.</p><p>On the Physical Abuse He Puts on His Body:</p><p>I literally spent my entire life destroying my entire body. I just know I have 15 years left, I have no where else to go. This is where I belong, and hope would have it that I would last that long, so we’ll see.</p><p>On Not Being Featured at WrestleMania 32:</p><p>I was in a very bad place at last year’s WrestleMania. Emotionally and physically, I was a bit beat up, but it was like all that rage and anger drove me this year and brought me to this year where I am now. I remember last year going around these media runs last year and going to place and place and place where people would say to me how I wrestled the Undertaker last year [WrestleMania 31] and Cena at [WrestleMania 30], you have no match on the card, is it over the whole Bray Wyatt character? I would tell everyone no it’s not, just be patient. It’s just really cool for me a year later I’m walking into WrestleMania as champion and defending the title.</p><p>On How He Felt Having a Program with The Rock at WrestleMania 32:</p><p>That’s the thing, I want to be The Rock, I want to be the next Rock, and being in the ring with him and seeing the energy that he can cause with the fans is an amazing thing, but I don’t want to be the guy that gets beat up by The Rock, I want be The Rock, I want to be better than The Rock.</p><p><span>On How He Felt After Winning the Heavyweight Title:</span></p><p><span>As I got it it just felt surreal. I don’t remember what I was thinking in that place, at that time, I can’t remember. I do remember walking out and holding it out for the first time and seeing people looking back at me and applauding it. I’m as evil as one can be and I know I am not hiding it, but it was a true statement that they made giving it back to me the way they did.</span></p><p>On Amping Up His Evil Character After Being Cheered When Winning the Title:</p><p>It didn’t help that Randy [Orton] has been a real dirt bag to me lately, but I don’t think like that, I can only be me. When I come out as champion and take on Randy at WrestleMania, I will be coming out as a violent human being. People can take it as to however they want to see it, only thing is violence is on my mind.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwhJFxbmlxXZe%2FosWMsLCarKRivK951pqlraGenHq1u4ybnGakmaCybsDHnmSrp5OgeqexxKWgp59dlrCku8ypo6KrmJqxbq3FrZyrZaeeu6%2B1zaBkraCVYsS4sYytoK2klWK7sMCMoZivoZ6ceqJ5zJqrnKBdlsFuw9Geqq2klaKur7XAZmprZZ2kv6Y%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f828709-bray-wyatt-on-wanting-to-be-like-the-rock-feeling-accomplished-after-winning-the-wwe-title-not-having-a-match-at-wrestlemania-32-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f828709-bray-wyatt-on-wanting-to-be-like-the-rock-feeling-accomplished-after-winning-the-wwe-title-not-having-a-match-at-wrestlemania-32-more.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f828709-bray-wyatt-on-wanting-to-be-like-the-rock-feeling-accomplished-after-winning-the-wwe-title-not-having-a-match-at-wrestlemania-32-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f828709-bray-wyatt-on-wanting-to-be-like-the-rock-feeling-accomplished-after-winning-the-wwe-title-not-having-a-match-at-wrestlemania-32-more.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f828709-bray-wyatt-on-wanting-to-be-like-the-rock-feeling-accomplished-after-winning-the-wwe-title-not-having-a-match-at-wrestlemania-32-more.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f828709-bray-wyatt-on-wanting-to-be-like-the-rock-feeling-accomplished-after-winning-the-wwe-title-not-having-a-match-at-wrestlemania-32-more.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cassidy-hutchinson-instagram-posts-photos-videos-and-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cassidy-hutchinson-instagram-posts-photos-videos-and-more.html>Cassidy Hutchinson Instagram posts, photos, videos and more</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./shannon-purser.html>Shannon Purser</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./shannon-purser.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
