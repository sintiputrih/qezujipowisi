But you may be surprised to know all of the gentlemen she’s been involved with.</p><p>Many of Gomez's relationships have remained rumors, but some were confirmed after the fact. After dating men like <strong><a href=#>Justin Bieber</a></strong> and The Weeknd very publicly, Gomez may be attempting to keep her romantic life a little more private.
