They <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>divorced in 2011</a> after <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Beauvais discovered Nilon was having an affair</a>. Beauvais told PEOPLE at the time, "My focus at this time is on my kids and healing the pain."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a blog post for PEOPLE in 2012, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Love Me As I Am</a> author wrote about her dream of having kids.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"As much as I love what I have accomplished so far as an actress, I have to say that being a mom — with all of its challenges and rewards — has been the best role of my life," Beauvais wrote, adding that she was the youngest of seven children and her mom has 25 grandchildren.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I always wanted to have kids, and when I dreamed about my future, I pictured having a boy first and then a girl — the perfect nuclear family," she continued.

"To this day, my happiest moments are when all three of my boys are with me hanging out at home. Even though they are a generation apart, they love each other so much," Beauvais wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The former The Real co-host credits her kids with contributing to her "full life," and says they're part of the reason she's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>in no rush to settle down</a>. "I don't want to just bring anybody in as a seat filler. I really want it to be the person. I feel like we put so much pressure on women to have a man, be married, have kids.

"I was modeling in New York when I met his dad. We immediately fell in love and got married after only two months. Crazy, right?! Two years later, Oliver appeared on the scene. He was the best baby, so easy and happy. I took him everywhere with me — on photo shoots, on location, and he did so well on airplanes, too."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Oliver began dabbling in rap music at age 10, later adopting <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>the stage name Jayson Rose</a>. He has also acted in a few TV shows, including appearing alongside his mom on The Jamie Foxx Show. However, music remained his passion — he later released a Blunts and Starbucks mixtape and performed with artists such as Talib Kweli, Dom Kennedy and others.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He has been open about his sobriety journey after struggling with addiction throughout his youth. Oliver credited his wife, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Samantha Saunders</a>, whom he married in May 2022, and their son, Oliver Jr., with motivating him to turn his life around.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For years I had been trying to fight it. I had gone to rehab, I had talked to people, therapists, all type of stuff like that," he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told Confessional Magazine</a> in 2021. "Even though I told myself when I felt like I was ready to stop, and I wanted to stop I could, but it was easier said than done. Then I swear, I swear, it was God, and my wife and my son, and it was just one day, none of that stuff mattered."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Garcelle Beauvais Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September 2022, however, Samantha accused Oliver of cheating on her with Vanderpump Rules star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Raquel Leviss</a>, among other women, while working at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Lisa Vanderpump</a>'s Vanderpump à Paris in Las Vegas, per <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Page Six</a>. Oliver responded on Instagram, according to the outlet, writing, "I apologize for my Sons Mother Putting My Business Out There. We Are Getting Divorced."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Viewers watched the drama play out during a March 2023 episode of Vanderpump Rules. Leviss met Oliver while on a girls' trip to Las Vegas, and the pair ended up <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>making out at a club</a>. Beauvais later told Entertainment Tonight that she "couldn't take" watching her kid kiss on national TV.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I found myself watching it through my fingers," she said. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>You don't want to see your kid makeout</a>. And it felt like it was the entire episode. Felt like it slowed down to a crawl."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In May 2023, Beauvais told PEOPLE that it "hurts her heart" to see Oliver get tangled up in a dramatic storyline for reality television.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My friends were like ... they were mad for me, and they were like, '<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>We felt like Oliver was used</a>.' But <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Lisa [Vanderpump]</a> has been great, and she stood up for him, and I appreciate that, and we move on," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the drama, Oliver regularly shares snaps of his little boy on Instagram. In October 2022, Oliver and Beauvais celebrated his son's birthday with a trip to the aquarium. The proud dad shared a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>photo</a> of him holding Oliver Jr. while Beauvais points up at the fish tank.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to hanging out with his son, Oliver regularly spends time with his two younger brothers and mom. He posted a family <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>photo</a> of him, Oliver Jr., Jax, Jaid and Beauvais in May 2022, with the caption "Family First !! 💙💙💙💙💙💙," before joking that Beauvais "Couldn't Get a Girl If She Tried."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On both RHOBH and social media, Beauvais has repeatedly expressed how proud she is of Oliver for overcoming his struggles. "I love you so much! you have taught me just as much As I've taught you 😊I am proud to be your mom and to see the man you've become💙❤️🙏🏽 ," she captioned a series of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>photos</a> in February 2021.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now that she is a grandma, the reality star also enjoys seeing her son as a dad. "Watching Oliver <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>become a dad</a> has been one of the greatest joys of my life," she wrote on Father's Day in June 2022.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jax-joseph-nilon-16></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Jax Joseph Nilon, 16</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Garcelle Beauvais and her son Jax.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Garcelle Beauvais Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jax Joseph Nilon, along with his twin brother Jaid Thomas Nilon, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>was born on Oct. 18, 2007</a>, in Los Angeles. Jax was born at 8:30 p.m. and weighed 4 lbs. 7 oz.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, Beauvais said in a statement, "We're so in love with them.

It took blood, sweat (both the good and bad kind!), lots of tears, and most importantly, fertility treatments. But I finally got pregnant. It was truly a miracle," Beauvais wrote in a blog post for PEOPLE.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Christopher Polk/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added that she was "a bit disappointed" to find out she was having two boys — "I'm such a girly-girl, and I couldn't believe I wasn't getting a little mini-me!" — but that she was "so excited" for her sons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Even though they're fraternal twins, I wondered if they would share a lot of similar personality traits.

On Aug. 24, 2022, Jax <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>spoke out against harassment</a> he's received from RHOBH fans on Instagram, which Beauvais reposted to her Instagram Story.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Well I'd like to start off by saying I am still a kid and wish to not be viewed as a fully matured adult, because I am not one," Jax wrote. "It is currently my first week of high school and, instead of enjoying it like most kids at my school, I have to deal with being attacked on social media."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, adding that he "did not sign up for this show, nor do I have anything to do with the show's drama."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I just want to be a normal kid," he said, insisting that his Instagram account is "not for publicity nor the public's gaze." He added, "However, middle-aged women spamming me with racist and crude comments about my family is not what I expected for my first week of high school."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier in the 12th season of RHOBH, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Erika Girardi</a> told Jax to "get the f--- out of here" at Beauvais' 55th birthday party. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>She later apologized</a>, writing on her Instagram Story, "I did not hire bots to attack Jax, and my offer to apologize to him, in person, still stands."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beauvais also spoke out on Instagram after the hateful messages started, writing, "I'm usually a very strong woman I've been raised to be strong my life has taught me to be strong but when it comes to my kids!

No book can really tell you how to hold one and burp the other, which I was doing at 4 o'clock in the morning."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beauvais later launched a children's book series based on Jax and Jaid's "experiences as twins of mixed race who split their time between two homes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>another blog post for PEOPLE</a>, Beauvais shared more about co-parenting with Nilon. "Frankly, I miss my boys so much when they're not with me. While it's nice to get the break (and a chance to have a clean house!) while they're with their dad, it's also unnervingly quiet. As weird as it sounds, I find myself having to figure out what do with my time at home when the boys aren't with me," she wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-92 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But she and Nilon always put the twins first. "It's better for them to see us both at their sporting events and school activities," she explained. "We also do things to help the boys feel at home in both of our houses. They have clothing at both places, but they bring special stuffed animals, toys or books with them when they travel between their homes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jaid plays basketball for Sierra Canyon and was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>on the homecoming court</a> in October 2022. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>He's 6' 3"</a>, according to his Instagram bio, and he often shares photos and videos on the court. For his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>8th grade graduation</a> in May 2022, Beauvais wrote, "You make me proud every day!"</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-96 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Barry King/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The boys are no strangers to high-profile events, having attended everything from awards show to movie premieres since they were young. Their first red carpet event was at the launch of Beauvais' children's jewelry line, Petit Bijou, on Nov. 15, 2008, where they wore matching white T-shirts with their mom and Nilon. Ine June 2022, the twins <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>accompanied Beauvais to the MTV Movie & TV Awards</a>, where they posed for photos with their mom on the carpet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite her life in the spotlight, Beauvais' number one focus has always been her sons. In July 2022, she shared an "appreciation post" for Jaid, Jax and Oliver on Instagram, posting a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>photo</a> of the trio alongside a sweet caption. "You boys make me so proud … you are loving, kind, and respectful. You show respect to people even when they don't deserve it.
