The Internet has been agitated by this question over the identical last names of these two Hall of Famers.</strong></p><p>Former American football offensive lineman Joe Thomas played in the NFL for 11 seasons, all with the Cleveland Browns.</p><p>At the University of Wisconsin, where he played collegiate football, Joe was an outstanding player who won several awards.</p><p>Joe quickly made a name for himself as one of the best offensive linemen in the NFL.</p><p>He was considered one of the greatest left tackles in NFL history and was chosen for the Pro Bowl in each of his first 10 seasons.</p><p>Thomas was renowned for his reliability and his pass-protection abilities.</p><p>Similar to this, retired linebacker Zach Thomas had a prosperous NFL career. Before joining the NFL, he played football at Texas Tech University.</p><p>The American football player was chosen by the Miami Dolphins in the fifth round of the 1996 NFL Draft.</p><p>Zach gained notoriety during his brilliant career for his courage, shrewdness, and superb tackling skills.</p><p>He was regarded as one of the most outstanding linebackers of his era and served as the Dolphins’ defensive backbone.</p><h2>Zach Thomas and Joe Thomas: Related in the Hall of Fame?</h2><p>Zach Thomas is not related to Joe Thomas. Despite having the same last name, they are not related.</p><p>Zach was born in Pampa, Texas, in 1973, while Joe was born in Brookfield, Wisconsin, in 1984. They are not related; they are two separate people.</p><p>Former American football offensive lineman Joe Thomas was a Cleveland Browns fan for the whole of his playing career.</p><p>Unfortunately, a triceps injury sustained during the 2017 season ended Joe’s playing career.</p><p>Even though his career was cut short, he had a significant influence on the game and was well-liked by rivals, teammates, and fans alike.</p><p>Zach Thomas, a former linebacker with the Miami Dolphins, is also an American football player.</p><p>Zach was selected seven times to the Pro Bowl and five times to the First Team All-Pro throughout his NFL career.</p><p>Although he played for the Dallas Cowboys for one season, he was a member of the Dolphins for most of his career.</p><p>Zach Thomas, one of the finest linebackers in NFL history, retired after the 2009 season, leaving behind a phenomenal career.</p><h2>Joe and Zach Thomas: Disparities in Family and Wealth</h2><p>Zach Thomas was the younger brother of Katina Thomas and the elder brother of Bart Thomas. His parents are Steve and Bobby Thomas.</p><p>Jason Taylor, a former teammate of Zach’s on the Miami Dolphins, and Katina were previously married. The couple is parent to three children.</p><p>But in February 2015, after 15 years of marriage, the couple filed for divorce. Zach wed Maritza, his lifelong companion, in 2006; the two of them are parents to three kids.</p><p>Conversely, Eric and Sally gave birth to Joe Thomas. He completed his high school education at Brookfield Central and earned his Wisconsin College degree in 2006.</p><p>Logan, Camryn, Jack, and Reese are Joe’s four children, born in 2007 after he wed Annie.</p><p>At his enshrinement ceremony on Saturday, Joe was overjoyed to have his whole family there to support him.</p><p>Joe Thomas is thought to be worth $48 million, whilst Zach Thomas is projected to be worth $10.4 million.</p><p>Joe’s earnings from salary/winnings of $19.3 million and sponsorships totaling $500,000 are the main sources of his net worth.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
