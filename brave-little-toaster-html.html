Since then, there hasn’t been much the studio wasn’t willing to try, always staying in the forefront of animation innovation. But when John Lasseter went to Disney in the late eighties to request a computer-animated film about anthropomorphic household appliances called <a href=#>The Brave Little Toaster</a>, the studio turned him down.</p><p>Now, this cult-classic animated feature is only available to stream on <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=YouTube data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>YouTube</a>:</p><p>In the vast realm of animated classics, The Brave Little Toaster has acquired a larger fan base than ever expected. Directed by Jerry Rees, this 1987 gem transports us to a world where everyday household appliances and electronics come alive with emotions and embark on extraordinary adventures.</p><p><strong>The 1987 animated film The Brave Little Toaster can only be streamed on YouTube.</strong></p><p>Rooted in the 1980 novella by Thomas M. Disch, the film presents a delightful blend of heartwarming storytelling, relatable characters, and a unique perspective on the hidden lives of inanimate objects.</p><p>The Brave Little Toaster tells the tale of five anthropomorphic household appliances — Toaster, Lampy, Blanky, Radio, and Kirby who each possess their own distinct traits, echoing human emotions in fascinating ways. From the cheerful and bright Lampy to the warm and empathetic Toaster, these characters come to life as they embark on a quest to find their long-lost owner, Rob.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/brave-little-toaster-3-900x506.jpg><p><a href=#>Disney</a> first purchased the rights to The Brave Little Toaster in 1982, though, like many stories bought by production companies, it wasn’t touched for years. Then, in the mid-eighties, John Lasseter — who would later become the Chief Creative Officer at Pixar — pitched the idea of creating a computer-animated film based on the story.</p><p>However, when Lasseter admitted that a computer-animated feature would cost as much as a traditionally animated film, the pitch was rejected, and Lasseter was dismissed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Film critic Leonard Maltin said The Brave Little Toaster was “among the finest animated films <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Disney data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Disney</a> never made.”</strong></p><p>Finally, The Brave Little Toaster was brought to life in 1987 by Disney’s independent subsidiary Hyperion Pictures and The Kushner-Locke Company. Many graduates from the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), including original members of Pixar Animation Studios, contributed to the making of the movie, infusing the film with creativity and innovation that would inspire it to become a cult classic, beloved by many even decades later.</p><p>At its core, The Brave Little Toaster delves into the fear of abandonment and the longing for reunification with someone we cherish. This resonates deeply as we witness the appliances embark on their quest to find Rob, their owner. Moreover, the film highlights the idea of valuing both objects and relationships from the past, capturing a sentiment of nostalgia that many can relate to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/brave-little-toaster-4-900x506.jpg><p>The Brave Little Toaster garnered a positive reception upon its release, with critics praising its inventive characters, charming dialogue, and impressive animation.</p><p>Audiences deeply resonated with the seamless blend of humor and sincere storytelling, as well as the profound and relatable themes touching on some of life’s hardest moments. Film critic Leonard Maltin said The Brave Little Toaster was “among the finest animated films Disney never made.”</p><p><strong>The Brave Little Toaster is a testament to the power of storytelling and the creativity that flourishes when artists are given the freedom to bring their vision to life.</strong></p><p>Though The Brave Little Toaster was given a limited theatrical release, the film’s popularity skyrocketed on home video, claiming places in children’s hearts all over the world and planting the seeds for an enduring legacy. The film’s impact reached beyond the screen, influencing the careers of many of its cast and crew members.</p><p>Notably, CalArts graduates who contributed to the film went on to play significant roles in shaping the animation landscape, collaborating on iconic projects within Disney and other studios.</p><p>Years before Pixar began to give every inanimate object they could think of feelings, The Brave Little Toaster explored the emotions of five little household items, infusing everyday objects with magic. The film’s ability to communicate deep themes like abandonment, redemption, and the value of the past in ways that children can understand and relate to is one reason why this animated movie from the eighties has become one of the most beloved classic films of all time.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/brave-little-toaster-900x506.jpg><p>The Brave Little Toaster is a testament to the power of storytelling and the creativity that flourishes when artists are given the freedom to bring their vision to life. As we reflect on this animated gem, we’re reminded that even the most ordinary objects can have extraordinary stories to tell and that beneath their exteriors lies a world of emotions waiting to be discovered.</p><p>So, the next time you see your toaster or radio, you might just wonder — what adventures and emotions might they be hiding when we’re not looking?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iaopbDpnnLoqutpJViwbCt0q2cq2aYqbqt</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrave-little-toaster-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbrave-little-toaster-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbrave-little-toaster-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbrave-little-toaster-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrave-little-toaster-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrave-little-toaster-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./fuling-villages-plains-biome-black-metal-scrap-shaman-berserker.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./fuling-villages-plains-biome-black-metal-scrap-shaman-berserker.html>Valheim fuling village guide - Polygon</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ray-stevenson.html>Ray Stevenson Wiki, Height, Age, Girlfriend, Wife, Children, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ray-stevenson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
