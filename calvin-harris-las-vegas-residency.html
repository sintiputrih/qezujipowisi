It got to the point where I was there a little too much.</p><p>"I got tired of it.”</p><p>Asked if it stifled his creativity, he said: “One million per cent. It was unreal. No tunes were being made.</p><p>“I didn’t make any tunes for a year or maybe a year and a half. I was growing carrots and that was great.</p><p>"I grew watermelons, which for a <a href=#>Scottish</a> lad, I was buzzing when I grew my first watermelon.</p><p>"But the creative juices weren’t flowing.”</p><p>Thankfully the super-star — <a href=#>due to wed DJ Vick Hope</a>, is now firing on all cylinders once again.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bizarre</h2></p><p>The One Kiss hitmaker had one of the summer’s biggest bangers with Miracle, which spent eight weeks at No1, and has revealed the unlikely secret to the song’s success — seagulls.</p><p>He said: “In Miracle, my song with <a href=#>Ellie Goulding</a>, I’ve got seagulls in the background, all the way through it.</p><p>“I’ve got a beachy audio track, very quietly, and there’s seagulls.</p><p>“I think the seagulls are in the unconscious mind, telling people that it’s summer, they want a 99 with a Flake in it and they’re going to listen to Miracle.”</p><p>After more than a decade in music Calvin has amassed a £220million fortune and is the world’s highest-paid DJ, but he confessed he is baffled at how he got his first record deal.</p><p>Calvin, who has just released a <a href=# aria-label="DJ mix from Ushuaia Ibiza (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">DJ mix from Ushuaia Ibiza</a> on Apple Music, said: “I still think it’s extraordinary that I managed to get that first album signed.</p><p>"It’s not very good. It’s a difficult listen.</p><p>"There’s some good tunes on there but I still think, ‘I don’t know how I did that’. I can’t sing.”</p><p>Speaking to Vernon Kay on on Radio 2’s Tracks Of My Years, he added: “The second album, I got through by the skin of my teeth because I’m Not Alone did well. The rest... there’s no hits at all.”</p><p>It worked out in the end, Calvin.</p><p>VICK HOPE couldn’t stop grinning as she celebrated her hen do – but she drew the line at strippers.</p><p><a href=#>The Radio 1 DJ</a> is getting married to Calvin Harris and whisked her mates away for <a href=#>a raucous weekend</a> at a spa which involved a life drawing session and a fancy dinner, which she wore a white feathered mini-dress for.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inside-radio-1-dj-vick-839271634-2.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inside-radio-1-dj-vick-839271636-1.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inside-radio-1-dj-vick-839271633-1.jpg><p>As she returned to the airwaves yesterday she had to explain if there were any X-rated activities, after a video was shared on Instagram of a male pal dancing on her as she sat in a chair.</p><p>Vick said: “There were no strippers.
