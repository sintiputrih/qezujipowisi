The film will take place in the Sony Marvel universe and will follow Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius, a biochemist who suffers from a rare blood condition. After trying to create a cure for himself, things take a turn for the worse when he accidentally infects himself leading to his change into a vampire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Jared Leto Almost Didn’t Star In ‘My So-Called Life’?</a></span></p><p>As promotional <a href=#>videos and trailers continue to roll</a> out ahead of the film’s release, <a href=#>many believe the film will be a flop</a>. On the other hand, others are excited about what the feature could mean for the future of the Sony universe – specifically how it will <a href=#>interconnect with the widely adored Spider-Man</a> films. Despite the mixed opinions, it's indisputable that Morbius has a pretty impressive cast including some very talented actors, such as Michael Keaton and Matt Smith. But which actor out of them is the richest? Let’s take a look at how the Morbius cast ranks based on their net worth.</p><h2 id=adria-arjona-as-martine-bancroft---500-thousand><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Adria Arjona As Martine Bancroft - $500 Thousand</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coming up first at number 8, we have Puerto Rican actress, Adria Arjona. Prior to her role in Morbius, Arjona stumbled into her big break in 2015 when she portrayed the role of Emily in the hit crime series, True Detective. Most notably, Arjona portrayed the leading role in the NBC retelling of The Wizard of Oz in their series, Emerald City where she portrayed the role of Dorothy Gale. In Morbius, Arjona portrays the character of Martine Bancroft, the fiancée of vampire and leading man Michael Morbius (Leto). According to Idol Networth,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Arjona’s net worth comes up to $500 thousand</a>, placing her eighth on this list.</p><h2 id=corey-johnson-as-mr-fox---700-thousand><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Corey Johnson As Mr. Fox - $700 Thousand</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Up next and taking the number 7 spot on the list, we have Corey Johnson. Since his first-ever on-screen acting role way back in 1990, the character actor developed his career through portraying wacky and eccentric supporting roles as well as doing general background actor work. Some of Johnson’s roles came about in some pretty big Hollywood films such as Saving Private Ryan, The Mummy, Hellboy, The Bourne Legacy, and Kingsman: The Secret Service to name a few. In Morbius, Johnson portrays the character of Mr. Fox. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Johnson has amassed a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $700 Thousand.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The ‘Eternals’ Cast Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=al-madrigal-as-agent-rodriguez---1-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Al Madrigal As Agent Rodriguez - $1 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coming in next and taking the 6th spot on the list, we have California-born comedian and actor, Al Madrigal. The 50-year-old comic first rose to fame due to his regular appearances on The Daily Show With Jon Stewart starting in 2011 and spanning 5 seasons. Outside his comedy career, Madrigal has been a part of several films and television projects as an actor. His most notable roles include Luis in the 2018 comedy Night School and Edgar Martinez in Showtime’s I'm Dying Up Here. In Morbius, Madrigal portrays the character of Agent Alberto Rodriguez, one of the leading FBI agents who get hired to track and hunt down Morbius. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Madrigal has amassed a net worth of $1 million.</p><h2 id=tyrese-gibson-as-simon-stroud---6-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Tyrese Gibson As Simon Stroud - $6 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coming in at number 5 on the list we have the California-born singer and actor, Tyrese Gibson. Prior to developing an acting career, Gibson released several R&B hits, most famously his 2002 song, “How You Gonna Act Like That”. In 2001, Gibson landed his first-ever acting role as Jody in the film Baby Boy. However, it was his role as Roman Pearce in the Fast & Furious franchise that really allowed Gibson to make his mark in the acting industry. In Morbius, Gibson portrays the character of Simon Stroud, the secondary party hired to hunt Morbius beside Madrigal’s Agent Rodriguez. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Gibson’s net worth comes up to a total of $6 million.</p><h2 id=jared-harris-as-emil-nikols---8-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jared Harris As Emil Nikols - $8 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Next up and taking the 4th spot on this list we have 60-year-old Englishman, Jared Harris. Perhaps most widely recognized for his role as Lane Pryce in the Golden Globe-winning series, Mad Men, the Hammersmith-born actor has been a part of several big-name film and television projects such as The Man From U.N.C.L.E, The Crown, Chernobyl, and Carnival Row. In Morbius, Harris portrays the character of Emil Nikols. According to Celebrity Net Worth, throughout the span of his acting career, Harris has amassed a net worth of $8 million.</p><h2 id=matt-smith-as-loxias-crown---9-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Matt Smith As Loxias Crown - $9 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As we move on to the top three richest Morbius cast members, we have another Englishman, Matt Smith, taking the bronze at number 3. Best known for his portrayal of the eleventh doctor in the iconic British series, Doctor Who, Smith has gone on to acquire some pretty impressive roles throughout his career such as those in The Crown and most recently, Last Night In Soho. In Morbius, Smith portrays the character of Loxias Crown, the villainous antagonist for the film who,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> according to film critics, steals the show</a>. According to Celebrity Net Worth Smith has amassed a net worth of $9 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Cast Of ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’: Who Is The Richest?</a></span></p><h2 id=michael-keaton-as-adrian-toomes---40-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Michael Keaton As Adrian Toomes - $40 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coming in second we have someone who is no stranger to the world of superheroism and the Marvel universe: Hollywood icon Michael Keaton. Best known for his iconic role as the masked billionaire Bruce Wayne in his portrayal of Batman, Keaton will be reprising his role as Adrian Toomes better known as The Vulture in Morbius. It is easy to see why the legend takes the second spot on this list as, according to Celebrity Net Worth, Keaton has amassed an incredible $40 million net worth.</p><h2 id=jared-leto-as-dr-michael-morbius---90-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jared Leto As Dr. Michael Morbius - $90 Million</span></h2><p>And finally, it probably comes as no surprise that the Morbius cast member taking the number one spot for highest net worth is the leading man himself, Jared Leto. Much like Keaton, Leto has ties to both Marvel and DC thanks to his portrayal of The Joker in the 2016 action film, Suicide Squad. However, his role as the morally grey vampire in Morbius will see Leto take on a far more complex anti-hero role. The House Of Gucci star’s absolutely massive net worth of $90 million places him firmly at the top of this list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Where Does Richard Madden’s Net Worth Stand After His Marvel Debut?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiamqukYrynecyoqZuhpah6s63NpJydZZKueq%2Bx02auqKqknXq0u82yZKaZoquyrXs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcast-of-morbius-ranked-by-net-worth-sony-marvel.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcast-of-morbius-ranked-by-net-worth-sony-marvel.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcast-of-morbius-ranked-by-net-worth-sony-marvel.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcast-of-morbius-ranked-by-net-worth-sony-marvel.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcast-of-morbius-ranked-by-net-worth-sony-marvel.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcast-of-morbius-ranked-by-net-worth-sony-marvel.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./weird-chandeliers-you-can-buy-on-amazon.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./weird-chandeliers-you-can-buy-on-amazon.html>The Crazy and Weird Chandeliers You Can Buy on Amazon</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jessica-williams-is-more-than-incredible-html.html>Jessica Williams Is More Than Incredible</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jessica-williams-is-more-than-incredible-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
