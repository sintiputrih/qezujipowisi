Original cast members Lindsay Hubbard, Carl Radke, and Kyle Cooke have been doing share houses in the Hamptons for years. Kyle's now-wife Amanda Batula was added the following year along with Carl's ex and Lindsay's bestie Danielle Olivera. The biggest cast shake-up of all came when season three rolled around. The <a href=#>Giggly Squad girls, Paige DeSorbo and Hannah Berner</a> changed the game when they showed up to the Hamptons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Is 'Summer House' Affecting Paige DeSorbo And Craig Conover's New Relationship?</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Season six of Summer House</a> is currently airing with Cooke, Hubbard, Radke, Batula, DeSorbo, Olivera, season four's addition Luke Gulbranson, as well as season five's Ciara Miller. Winter House star Andrea Denver traveled from Vermont to the Hamptons along with newbies Mya Allen and Alex Wach. It really is nice to appreciate the real-life friendships this crew has. Even though there is plenty of drama, at the end of the day, they are all just one big dysfunctional family.</p><h2 id=paige-desorbo-was-amanda-batula-39-s-bridesmaid><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Paige DeSorbo Was Amanda Batula's Bridesmaid</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These lovely girls met in 2018 when DeSorbo joined the Summer House cast. The pair hit it off instantly, and it was no surprise when a teary-eyed Amanda asked Paige to be one of her bridesmaids. Fans have loved watching these two form a true friendship over the years. The entire cast attended <a href=#>Kyle and Amanda's wedding</a> and got to share this special moment in their lives.</p><h2 id=carl-officiated-amanda-and-kyle-39-s-wedding><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Carl Officiated Amanda And Kyle's Wedding</span></h2><p>Carl Radke and Kyle Cooke are one of the Bravo sphere's favorite bromances. They met during season one of the show and have been attached at the hip ever since. Whether they are kissing in wigs or working on their monster of a brand together they are truly brothers for life. Radke says, “There’s no show on Bravo like our show. There’s no show on reality T.V. like ours.” He says even with the new people, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they all hang out together</a>." If being in business wasn't enough... Cooke asked his Radke to be his best man and even officiate his wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Paige DeSorbo From 'Summer House' And Her Amazon Livestream Fashion Hauls</a></span></p><h2 id=the-loverboy-family><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Loverboy Family</span></h2><p>Kyle Cooke created the brand Loverboy, but he employed his wife and his best friend to advance their Hard Tea careers. The company began in 2018 and has become a hit in the canned cocktail industry. Hibiscus Pom, White Tea Peach, and Black Tea Lemon are the seltzer drinks of the summer. This Bravo-lebrity endorsement co-founded by Amanda Batula, Kyle Cooke, and Carl Radke has a foundation of love, loyalty, and friendship.</p><h2 id=lindsay-and-danielle-39-s-friendship><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Lindsay And Danielle's Friendship</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lindsay Hubbard and Danielle Olivera have been loyal to one another since the day they met. Their Summer House friendship began early on in season two and has been going strong ever since. They have dealt with numerous breakups and makeups and have always stood by each other's side. In the midst of <a href=#>Lindsay's messy love triangle with Austen Kroll </a>and Ciara Miller, Olivera decides to step in and stand up for her girl. During a heated moment... she battles it out with roommate Miller and even gets a glass of red wine thrown at her.

Radke and Hubbard have been best friends for years and decided to take their friendship to the next level a few years back. Their relationship was explosive and toxic and didn't last longer than a few weeks. Carl Radke has opened up about his changed lifestyle and his decision to stay sober. Currently, love is finally in the air for these two Summer House guests! Amanda stated, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They'd been such good friends for so long</a>. You know, Carl literally moved into the same building as Lindsay because he sees her as such a good friend, she's so supportive of him, and it's like, they are so close in so many ways. And I've always said that some of the most successful relationships are built on friendships first... So if Lindsay and Carl make this work, it's probably one of the most obvious relationships, and I'm just really happy to see them both so happy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mya-allen-and-ciara-miller-39-s-emotional-conversation><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Mya Allen And Ciara Miller's Emotional Conversation</span></h2><p>During a recent episode of Summer House, Mya Allen, and Ciara Miller opened up to the whole house. Allen started the emotional conversation by sharing how hard it has been to fit in with a predominately white group of friends. Miller in tears added, “Last summer I was super intimidated to come to the Hamptons when it was all … it’s predominantly white,” she said. “But there’s an automatic feeling of I might not be adequate enough to fit in when people don’t look like you.” Allen also in tears told Denver she was very hurt when he called her the wrong name at the beach. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She added that it wasn’t malicious </a>but, “I’ve been in the house for four weeks,” Allen said. “I’m Mya …” In one of the rawest conversations Summer House has ever aired, the entire group shared a big hug and promised to check in on each other more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Nina Dobrev Has Done Some Wonderful Things To Support Boyfriend Shaun White's Snowboarding Career</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiamqukYrynedKupKadomK1sMHSnmSfqpmau6W%2FjKucmqRdobansY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcast-of-summer-house-friends-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcast-of-summer-house-friends-real-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcast-of-summer-house-friends-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcast-of-summer-house-friends-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcast-of-summer-house-friends-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcast-of-summer-house-friends-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-sign-up-palia-beta.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-sign-up-palia-beta.html>'Palia' Is the First Cozy MMO Here's How to Sign Up for its Beta</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./teen-moms-javi-marroquin-and-lauren-comeau-welcome-2nd-baby-together.html>Teen Mom's Javi Marroquin and Lauren Comeau Welcome 2nd Baby Together</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./teen-moms-javi-marroquin-and-lauren-comeau-welcome-2nd-baby-together.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
