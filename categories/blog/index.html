The biggest difference between them is where objects appear in focus. People with myopia (shortsightedness) see nearby objects more clearly. People with hyperopia (longsightedness) see distant objects more clearly.
Conversely, shortsightedness makes distant objects look blurry. Longsightedness blurs objects that are close to you.
