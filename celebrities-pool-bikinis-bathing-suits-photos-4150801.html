This means we’ve had no shortage of bikini Instagram pics from some of our favorite celebrities! Many stars, including <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Larsa Pippen</strong></a> and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>, have even done mini backyard photo shoots by sharing pics of themselves wearing their swimsuits by the pools at their homes. Let’s take a look at some of the very best bikini pics from celebs lounging by the pool in their two-pieces!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>Sofia Richie</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-7><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sofia Richie</strong></a> was all about that bikini life when she was caught <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lounging by the pool</a> on January 26. The young model, 22, sported a black, string two-piece while hanging out in the sun. Sofia appeared to be reading just as the photo was snapped. The photographer, however, captured a totally different side of the model from what fans are often accustomed to seeing. Sofia squinted and made a silly face at the camera just as the pic was snapped!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>Kim Kardashian&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-12><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kim</strong> <strong>Kardashian</strong></a> spent her January 19 soaking up the sun in “paradise.” The gorgeous mother-of-four, 40, took to Instagram and shared this beautiful photo of herself rocking a two-piece while lounging by the pool. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>SKIMS mogul</a> looked positively radiant, and worked <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a cute short hairstyle</a>, too! “This is more than life…this is paradise,” she captioned the image, along with sun, palm tree and sparkling emojis!</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>Larsa Pippen</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Larsa is definitely no stranger to posting a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sexy bikini pic</a> on social media. We’ve seen her take mirror selfies in her bathing suits, while also posing on balconies and in her living room. Back in June, though, she wore her white two-piece from Pretty Little Thing while laying by the pool. Larsa posed with one foot in the water and one on the concrete, with sunglasses on and her hair pulled back into a half ponytail. Stunning, of course!</p><p id=content-paragraph-18><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-22>In May, Kylie <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rocked a green bikini</a> and took a similar picture by a massive private pool. She sat on the edge of the pool in the shallow end, with both of her feet in the water by the stairs. Kylie’s two-piece was a sporty look with fuller coverage than we’re normally used to seeing on her. At the time the photo was taken, she was also rocking long, honey-blonde extensions and they were on full display as she struck her pose.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-27>The KarJenners spent quite a bit of time at&nbsp;<strong>Kris Jenner’s</strong> Palm Springs home amidst the earlier days of the coronavirus quarantine, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a> shared her poolside bikini pic during that trip. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>She rocked</a> a blue swimsuit, which featured very skimpy bottoms that were held together by only the tiniest string. Rather than sitting down by the pool like Kylie and Larsa, Kourtney posed while standing up in front of the water. She also wore sunglasses to complete her summertime look.</p><p id=content-paragraph-28><strong>Rebel Wilson</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-32>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rebel Wilson</strong></a> has been working hard on her weight loss in quarantine, and she proudly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rocked a bikini</a> to show it off in a new photo posted on July 25. Rebel took things a step further with her poolside pose by actually getting&nbsp;in the water! The Australian actress rocked a lime green swimsuit while wading in a hot tub, with the pool fully visible in the background. She kept cool with sunglasses and a baseball cap, as well.</p><p id=content-paragraph-33><strong>Olivia Culpo</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-37><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Olivia Culpo</strong></a> wore a white swimsuit to relax in the pool. She held a glass of wine while floating on a massive pool float in her bikini for a pic that she posted back in July. Olivia looked completely relaxed and carefree, and captioned the image, “Wine not,” with an emoji of a wine glass. Considering Olivia was one of this year’s&nbsp;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover girls, it’s no secret that she knows how to rock a bikini like a pro!</p><p id=content-paragraph-38><strong>Elizabeth Hurley</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-42><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Elizabeth Hurley</strong></a> is one of our favorite bikini queens. She has her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>own line of swimsuits</a>, Elizabeth Hurley Beach, so she’s often posting photos in sexy bikini looks. In January, she was red hot in a red two-piece while seated by the pool. She straddled the edge of the pool in the picture, with one hand holding onto a giant pink raft. Of course, she made it all look perfectly natural, too!</p><p id=content-paragraph-43><strong>Ariana Biermann</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-47>Meanwhile, <strong>Ariana Biermann</strong> took a similar approach to Olivia for her backyard bikini pic. She wore a light pink two-piece while lounging on a giant raft in the water. She also matched her headband to her bathing suit as she soaked up the sun and keeping cool without getting in the water.
