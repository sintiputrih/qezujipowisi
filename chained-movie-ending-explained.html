Yet, his daughter <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Lynch</a> has made a good effort at breaking into the cinema world, and her fourth film <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chained</a></strong> is probably one of her better movies.</p><p data-characters=671 data-current-count=951 data-injectable=true>Nowadays, the younger Lynch tends to focus on directing episodes of television shows (credits include The Walking Dead, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessica Jones</a>, and Agents of S.H.I.E.l.D), but in Chained, a pyschological horror about a disturbed man who keeps a young boy prisoner for years, she showed that she could make a compelling (and horrifying) film. And, unlike much of her dad’s work, the movie’s plot doesn’t hurt your brain to think about. With that said, the ending of the film is a little ambiguous, which has led a lot of viewers to wonder what it all means. If you’re one of those people, then read ahead for our take on Chained‘s shocking conclusion.</p><h2 id=h-who-stars-in-chained data-injectable=false>Who stars in Chained?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>There are a lot of familiar faces in Chained. Fans of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MCU</a> will recognize the actor in the lead role, Vincent D’Onofrio, who also plays Kingpin/Wilson Fisk. D’Onofrio has also appeared in Men in Black and the incredible Full Metal Jacket, so his acting chops are second to none.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>He’s joined by some other faces that may be familiar to viewers. Child star Evan Bird (The Killing) is in the first section of the film, and the older version of his character is played by Aussie actor Eamon Farren, who worked with the director’s father in his 2017 Twin Peaks revival, and has more recently appeared as Cahir in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher</a>.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>Also in the movie are Jake Webber (Meet Joe Black, Dawn of the Dead, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Medium</a>), Conor Leslie (The Man in the High Castle, and also Wonder Girl/Donna Troy in the HBO/DCEU series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Titans</a>), and Emmy winning English actress Julia Ormond (The Walking Dead: The World Beyond, Nurse Jackie). Jennifer Lynch herself also has a small cameo.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What happens in Chained?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Chained-2.png><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>The movie begins innocently enough, with a woman named Sarah (Ormond) and her son (Bird) taking a cab home from a trip to the cinema, only for the driver Bob (D’Onforio) to abduct them. A childhood victim of abuse himself, Bob has become a sadistic serial killer. After sexually assaulting and murdering Sarah, he chains her son to a wall and begins calling him Rabbit.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>We jump a few years and Rabbit remains Bob’s slave. However, the killer attempts to get more involved in Rabbit’s life, including teaching him about the human body. He then tries to convince Rabbit that only he cares about him by telling him that Rabbit’s father has remarried. Believing he’s brainwashed Rabbit enough, he releases him from his chains.</p><p data-characters=526 data-current-count=902 data-injectable=true>In a further attempt to get Rabbit under his spell, Bob finds a local high school yearbook and asks the teen to pick a victim. After forcing him to pick someone named Angie, Bob finds her, abducts her, and leaves her in a room with Rabbit. The young man struggles to hurt her, instead bonding with her, but when Bob threatens them both Rabbit stabs her in the stomach. Bob orders him to drag her body to where the rest of his victims are, then decides that he and Rabbit are going to go to the city to find new blood to spill.</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>During the drive Rabbit says no to every possible victim, angering Bob. Bob then sees Rabbit has been trying to escape by writing the word “help” on the side of the cab, and immediately realizes that the tortured teen had used the anatomy knowledge he’d gained to stab Angie in a non-lethal spot. In a fit of rage he knocks Rabbit unconscious, then heads back home to finish off Angie.</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>Angie, hidden, manages to outsmart Bob and cut his achilles tendon. Rabbit wakes up and joins the stuggle, murdering Bob and burying him next to his victims. A disturbed Rabbit then goes in search of his father, Brad, and confronts him. It quickly transpires that Brad was Bob’s brother, and paid his psychotic sibling to get rid of his wife and child so he could remarry.</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true>With the truth out, Brad goes into a rage, attacking Rabbit (who we discover is called Tim), and then his new wife Marie. Tim manages to overpower him and end his life, before Marie tells him to run away. She then calls the cops and claims a burglar murdered her husband.</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>With nowhere else to go, Tim returns to Bob’s house. We see him shut the garage door behind him, then hear him following a routine that seems horrifyingly similar to Bob’s. All the while the credits role.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Chained movie ending, explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Chained-3.png><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>Lynch and other members of the cast and crew have never really truly explained the ending, which can be read in a number of ways. As we hear Tim engaging in activity that sounds similar to Bob’s actions, it could be surmised that Bob did manage to brainwash the teen into becoming a sadistic killer. After all, we don’t know what happened to Angie, as the last time we saw her she was resting in the house after her traumatic few days.</p><p data-characters=714 data-current-count=714 data-injectable=true>One of the biggest clues we get is the sound of Tim cutting pieces of paper. Throughout the film we saw Bob cutting newspaper articles about his victims. Perhaps Tim was cutting one out about Bob himself, who despite being a loner, did have colleagues and other people around him, so his disappearance could have made the news. Or, he might have been snipping around an article about his birth father, whose murder by an alleged burglar would have certainly made the papers. Then there’s the chance he’s cutting out a piece about Angie, as she had been missing for quite some time. If that’s the case, there’s a heavy implication he finishes the job in a way that would have made Bob proud.</p><p data-characters=613 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>A lot of Chained is about generational trauma, and repeating patterns of abuse. The cyclical nature of these kinds of horrible crimes in real life is well documented, and Lynch makes sure to show this in her film. Throughout the movie we see flashback scenes of Bob’s childhood with his abusive father, who even forced his son and wife to have sex for his own pleasure. So, while we see Bob as a monster, we also get to understand the forces that shaped him. Now, we’ve seen Tim suffer through something similar, so the message could very well be that he is trapped in the cycle of pain and abuse too.</p><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>However, there is a more positive ending that could be taken from the film. Rabbit, while definitely a killer, was only violent when he was protecting others, or attempting to free himself. He killed Bob to save Angie, and Brad to protect Marie. However, we’ll never truly know if Bob managed to poison Tim’s mind enough to turn him into another sadistic killer, or if the cycle of abuse was broken and Tim was simply exhibiting other patterns of behavior learned from the only adult he ever truly knew.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What did critics think of Chained?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jennifer-Lynch-Chained.jpg><p data-characters=675 data-current-count=975 data-injectable=false>Chained received mix reviews for a number of reasons, but overall it’s seen as one of Jennifer Lynch’s better efforts. While the tense, absorbing nature of the film was praised, as was its unflinching portrayal of violence, many critics felt it leaned too hard into the gory and unmentionable, sacrificing story telling for shock value. Others felt it was nothing but “torture porn” and considered it anti-feminist, given Bob’s victims are by and large women. With that said, the way it tackled patterns of abuse and violence that can snake through generations was seen as a big plus, as were many of the performances, especially that of Farren.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomqGZmaOypXnMqK2inV2au6W1zaBknrCgoa6qusSdZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchained-movie-ending-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchained-movie-ending-explained.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchained-movie-ending-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchained-movie-ending-explained.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchained-movie-ending-explained.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchained-movie-ending-explained.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./coco-vandeweghe-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./coco-vandeweghe-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html>Coco Vandeweghe Age, Wiki, Biography, wife, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./683668-love-and-hip-hop-cast.html>&amp;quot;Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop Cast&amp;quot;: Who Stars In The Show?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./683668-love-and-hip-hop-cast.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
