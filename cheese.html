When I was a little kid, I remember my mom covering the stoop on the back patio&nbsp;with ripped-open paper bags, and&nbsp;my sister and I would spend hours removing the husks. I love sweet corn so many ways ‚Äì I top it onto pizza, mix it into cornbread and cornbread stuffing, stuff it into tacos, blend it into hummus, add it to soups, chowder, and chili, or top it onto salad.

Like so many spring and summer salads, it‚Äôs a perfect example of how fresh, in-season ingredients can combine to make a delicious dish in no time. This strawberry salad uses under 10 ingredients, but it still has an incredible mix of textures and flavors. The peak-season berries are sweet and juicy, and a handful of soft summer basil adds a surprising fresh accent. Toss in a little cheese and diced avocado for richness, pecans for crunch, and a drizzle of tangy balsamic,‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I‚Äôm so excited about this sweet potato lasagna recipe because it combines two of my favorite foods: sweet potatoes and lasagna! Instead of regular lasagna noodles, I use paper-thin sheets of sweet potato. I‚Äôm always a fan of finding inventive veggie substitutes for pasta and rice, but this sweet potato lasagna is what veggie dreams are made of. The tender sheets of sweet potato combine with a creamy filling, cozy herbs, and marinara sauce to create a comforting dish that just so happens to be good for you!

Or both? We‚Äôre celebrating both this year, so I created this crowd-pleasing butternut squash salad recipe because I know both friends AND family members will love it. It‚Äôs the kind of salad that will convert anyone to being a salad lover, because it‚Äôs filled with spiced roasted butternut squash, pomegranates, goat cheese, and pistachios. It‚Äôs a roasty, spicy, creamy, tangy combo that Jack and I are pretty obsessed with.

My plan was to use the last-surviving summer vegetables, particularly zucchini since it‚Äôs still growing rampant. Instead of using regular ricotta cheese as the filling, I would make a healthier ricotta mixture. Maybe I‚Äôd even blend a vegetable to make the ricotta filling. And then I realized ‚Äì oh wait, I have this Zucchini Lasagna Recipe in THE COOKBOOK that is already my favorite zucchini lasagna recipe of all time.

When I was younger, we used to go to the community pool, and they hosted this relay race game where you‚Äôd&nbsp;swim across the pool trying to push a slippery watermelon with you. It was harder than you think, especially when you‚Äôre a little kid. Afterward they‚Äôd cut up the watermelon for all the kids to eat. Between the splashy water and the watermelon juices, well, it was all a big fun slippery summery mess.

Yes, it works! The saying is true ‚Äì what grows together goes together. These were the first blueberries of the season, and I knew I wanted to make a simple recipe to really highlight them.
