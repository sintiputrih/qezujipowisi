However, this assumption couldn’t be further from the truth, as the two have frequently butted heads, with Abdul-Jabbar <a href=#>criticizing James for everything from vaccine hesitancy</a> to doing a "stupid" celebration after a clutch three-pointer against the Indiana Pacers.

Back in 2021, social media erupted after LeBron James chose not to leverage his platform to advocate for vaccination, and shared a meme comparing COVID-19 to the common cold. Unexpectedly, one of the most vocal and critical voices against this decision was none other than Abdul-Jabbar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lebron-james-interview-1.jpg><p>"While LeBron is a necessary and dynamic voice critical of police brutality against the Black community,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Abdul-Jabbar wrote on his Substack page</a>, “he needs to be the same necessary and dynamic advocate with vaccines, which could save thousands of Black lives right now.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though he refused to address Abdul-Jabbar’s comments directly, James took a defiant stance, doubling down with yet another controversial statement. "It's flu season, so people have forgotten about the flu. People have forgotten about common colds," he said. "That happens, especially with a lot of our kids in school. My daughter is in first grade, so a lot of these kids are getting, like, common colds and getting the flu. But no, I don't have any response to Kareem — at all."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is LeBron James' Relationship With Savannah James As Loving As It Appears?</a></span></p><p>Abdul-Jabbar later criticized James for celebrating his clutch three-point shot against the Indiana Pacers with what, according to him, was a “stupid, childish dance.” "It doesn't make sense," he said.

He's right — and for that I blame myself," he wrote. "Not for anything I did, but perhaps for not making more of an effort to reach out to him. By nature, I have never been a chummy, reaching-out kind of guy (as the media was always quick to point out). I’m quiet, shy, and am such a devoted homebody that you’d think I have agoraphobia. I like to read, watch TV, listen to jazz.

" When he started to make a name for himself, I was already pretty removed from the NBA world," he wrote.</p><p>"Except for certain gala events, I was just like any other fan, watching games on my TV in my sweatpants while munching on too many unhealthy snacks,” he continued. “That disconnect is on me. I knew the pressures he was under and maybe I could have helped ease them a bit. But I saw that LeBron had a friend and mentor in Kobe Bryant and I was just an empty jersey in the rafters. I couldn't imagine why he'd want to hang with someone twice his age.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoK6zscSmZJqalKq5brbAm5maql2Wu6V5y56Zq6eeYreiucSsZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF2aw6a%2BjKucnKemmr9urcWtnKtllprCpXs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-kareem-abdul-jabbar-and-lebron-james-relationship-ever-recover-after-feud.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-kareem-abdul-jabbar-and-lebron-james-relationship-ever-recover-after-feud.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-kareem-abdul-jabbar-and-lebron-james-relationship-ever-recover-after-feud.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-kareem-abdul-jabbar-and-lebron-james-relationship-ever-recover-after-feud.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-kareem-abdul-jabbar-and-lebron-james-relationship-ever-recover-after-feud.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-kareem-abdul-jabbar-and-lebron-james-relationship-ever-recover-after-feud.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./evan-winiker-bio-songs-music-group-age-height-weight-education-family-instagram.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./evan-winiker-bio-songs-music-group-age-height-weight-education-family-instagram.html>Evan Winiker Bio, Songs, Music Group, Age, Height, Weight, Education, Family, Instagram</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./deborah-columbu-bio-net-worth-height-husband-and-career.html>Deborah Columbu : Bio, Net Worth, Height, Husband And Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./deborah-columbu-bio-net-worth-height-husband-and-career.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
