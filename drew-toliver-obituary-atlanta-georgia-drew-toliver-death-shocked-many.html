<time>17 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Drew Toliver Obituary, Death Cause –&nbsp;</strong>On Thursday, February 18, 2016, the world said goodbye to an extraordinary soul, Benjamin Andrew Toliver, who resided at 379 Foster Road. He passed away at the Hock Family Pavilion in Durham, North Carolina, at the age of 84. As we reflect on his remarkable journey, we remember a life that, despite its hardships, was marked by resilience, love, and the bonds of family.</p><p>Benjamin Andrew Toliver was born in the state of New York, a place that would become the backdrop of his earliest years. The circumstances of his birth were marked by the absence of both his parents, a difficult beginning that foreshadowed the resilience he would show throughout his life. His father, James Toliver, had already passed away, as had his mother, Matilda C. Toliver.</p><p>Despite the adversity he faced, Benjamin’s life was a testament to the power of determination and the bonds of family. He not only carried the weight of his early loss but also the legacy of a family that would continue through his own descendants.</p><p>On Wednesday, February 24, at one o’clock in the afternoon, a funeral ceremony will take place at St. James Missionary Baptist Church. The service will be presided over by Pastor William Clayton, who will guide those gathered in celebrating Benjamin’s life and offering their final farewells. After the ceremony, the body will be laid to rest in the cemetery adjacent to the church, a final resting place that will provide a peaceful and comforting location for his memory.</p><p>Benjamin Andrew Toliver is survived by a loving family that spans generations. His children, Michael Enis, Andrew Toliver, Linda Toliver, and Kevin Toliver, each carry a piece of his legacy in their hearts. Additionally, he leaves behind a beloved sister, Annette Henderson, who is married to James Henderson. The bonds of family extend to a large number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren, each a testament to his enduring love and the strength of his lineage.</p><p>Rickey Higgins is also among his offspring, adding to the complexity and richness of his family connections. The love and support he provided to his children and grandchildren, the wisdom he shared, and the laughter he generated in their lives are immeasurable gifts that they will forever treasure.</p><p>On Tuesday, February 23, a viewing will be held in the chapel of the funeral home, commencing at noon and continuing until 6:00 o’clock in the evening. The visitation serves as an opportunity for those who knew Benjamin to come together, share their memories, and offer their support to his family during this difficult time. It is a chance to honor his memory and reflect on the impact he had on the lives of those who had the privilege of knowing him.</p><p>As the day progresses, the funeral service will take place, providing a solemn and heartfelt occasion for friends and family to say their final goodbyes and offer their condolences. The service will be a time for both mourning and celebration, as Benjamin’s life is remembered, cherished, and celebrated for the love and light he brought into the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaJyimsRuwM6loK%2BdomK8o7XTrpirsV2Wwa2tza2YZp%2BVpL%2BotcBmm6udp2LBsLjIr5yrZZSarrW0jKyfqJubmrFuucCnsGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdrew-toliver-obituary-atlanta-georgia-drew-toliver-death-shocked-many.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdrew-toliver-obituary-atlanta-georgia-drew-toliver-death-shocked-many.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdrew-toliver-obituary-atlanta-georgia-drew-toliver-death-shocked-many.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdrew-toliver-obituary-atlanta-georgia-drew-toliver-death-shocked-many.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdrew-toliver-obituary-atlanta-georgia-drew-toliver-death-shocked-many.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdrew-toliver-obituary-atlanta-georgia-drew-toliver-death-shocked-many.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./elly-de-la-cruz-pokes-shohei-ohtani-to-make-sure-hes-real.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./elly-de-la-cruz-pokes-shohei-ohtani-to-make-sure-hes-real.html>Elly De La Cruz pokes Shohei Ohtani to make sure he's real</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10-things-to-know-about-warriors-star-trayce-jackson-davis.html>10 things to know about Warrior's Star Trayce Jackson-Davis</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10-things-to-know-about-warriors-star-trayce-jackson-davis.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
