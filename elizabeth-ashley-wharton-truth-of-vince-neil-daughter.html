With her husband, Will Loomis, she is the bassist for Loomis and the Lust, an independent California pop-rock band.</p><p>For many years, the couple has led a happy married life. Do they have kids?

In 1981, he secured his first recording job with the band, who released their debut album Too Fast for Love.</p><p>In the years since, the musician has collaborated with the group on a number of hard-hitting albums and singles. Despite his enormous success in music, Neil’s marriage to Beth did not last long.</p><p>However, after four years of marriage, the couple divorced in 1985. Elle spent the majority of her time with her mother after their divorce, but she also saw her father on occasion.</p><p>Lynn is living a low-key existence after her divorce from Neil.</p><h2><span id=Elizabeth_has_how_many_siblings_Her_sister_passed_away_from_cancer>Elizabeth has how many siblings?
