Born Charles Isatz in Belgium, Gotch trained in Greco-Roman wrestling and other forms of amateur wrestling, regularly competing in his home country. Eventually, Isatz would find himself representing Belgium by <a href=#>competing in wrestling for the 1948 Summer Olympics</a> in London.

There, he’d start wrestling as Karl Gotch — a tribute to legendary World Champion Frank Gotch — and capture the World Heavyweight Championship for the Ohio-based American Wrestling Alliance. Gotch would hold the belt for nearly two years before dropping it to Lou Thesz in a <a href=#>title unification match</a> with the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-backstage-fight-that-changed-his-career><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Backstage Fight That Changed His Career</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/karl-gotch-buddy-rogers.jpg><p>More of a technician than a showman, Karl Gotch never had much success in North America, and his fate was sealed due to a backstage altercation with NWA World Champion “Nature Boy” Buddy Rogers.

There, he wrestled for legendary promotion Japan Wrestling Association as well as International Wrestling Enterprise, a promotion that lasted from 1966 to 1981. His time with IWE is of particular note, as Gotch had matches with fellow legends like Billy Robinson, and <a href=#>Andre the Giant</a>. Because of his accomplishments in Japan as well as his influence (see below), Karl Gotch would be nicknamed “Kami-sama,” which translates to “god.”</p><h2 id=brief-run-in-wwe><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Brief Run In WWE</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/karl-gotch-rene-goulet-wwe-tag-team-champions.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Karl Gotch had a brief run wrestling for WWE in 1960, but returned to the company in 1971, back when it was known as the World Wide Wrestling Federation. During this run, he’d have singles bouts with notable names like Jimmy Valiant and future WWE Champion Stan Stasiak, but would also form a tag team with Rene Goulet. Together, the two would <a href=#>capture the World Tag Team Championship</a>, becoming the second-ever champions and holding the belts for a 57-day reign.</p><h2 id=special-workout><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Special Workout</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/karl-gotch-training.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Karl Gotch’s studies also included Pehlwani, a martial art style from India. As part of this study, Gotch incorporated many exercises in his training, like Hindu squats and the bridge, which he taught to his students. As part of this training, Gotch developed a special workout, commonly referred to as <a href=#>the Gotch Bible</a>. The workout involves shuffling a deck of cards, and doing one of several exercises based on the card color and/or suit, with numerical value determining the number of repetitions.</p><h2 id=innovator-of-moves><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Innovator Of Moves</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/karl-gotch-german-suplex.jpg><p>Karl Gotch’s “God of Wrestling” moniker doesn’t just extend to his technical skill and success and influence in Japan.

In the years that followed, Gotch continued to wrestle for NJPW until his final match in 1982, having notable rematches with Inoki as well as a must-watch tag match alongside Lou Thesz.

Wrestlers who came through the NJPW Dojo under Gotch include Satoru Sayama (the original Tiger Mask), Akira Maeda, Yoshiaki Fujiwara, Tatsumi Fujinami, <a href=#>and Minoru Suzuki</a>, many of whom would follow in Gotch’s footsteps to specialize in shoot-style matches.

Gotch also trained pro wrestler, martial artist, and MMA pioneer Gene LeBell, and reportedly taught Masahiko Kimura his famous Kimura Lock, which defeated Helio Gracie and became a staple of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. On top of all that, two of Gotch’s trainees, Masakatsu Funaki and Minoru Suzuki, went on to found the influential Japanese MMA promotion Pancrase.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeWlrC1v4ywqZ6rpKG2r7OMn5inq12otbDBy51kpKafrHqirs6uq2ajkae5brPOrZqhZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffacts-wrestling-fans-should-know-about-karl-gotch.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffacts-wrestling-fans-should-know-about-karl-gotch.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffacts-wrestling-fans-should-know-about-karl-gotch.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffacts-wrestling-fans-should-know-about-karl-gotch.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffacts-wrestling-fans-should-know-about-karl-gotch.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffacts-wrestling-fans-should-know-about-karl-gotch.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./anthony-robbins-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./anthony-robbins-net-worth-2024.html>Anthony Robbins Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ronald-regans-daughter-patti-davis-warns-prince-harry-may-regret-writing-spare.html>Ronald Regan's daughter Patti Davis says Prince Harry may regret 'Spare', reveals remorse over own b</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ronald-regans-daughter-patti-davis-warns-prince-harry-may-regret-writing-spare.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
