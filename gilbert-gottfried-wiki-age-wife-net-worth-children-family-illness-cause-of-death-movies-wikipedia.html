He began on the stages of New York City at age of 15 and in the years to come became known as “the comedian’s comedian” because his live performances put aside political correctness while he delivers jokes that know no boundaries.</p><p>Within a few years Gilbert appeared on “Late Night with David Letterman”, “The Cosby Show” and for a short time as a cast member of “Saturday Night Live”. He also appeared on television programs like “Celebrity Wife Swap” and “Celebrity Apprentice”.</p><p>Gottfried’s work in television soon led to roles in film. Most notable was his scene as business manager Sidney Bernstein in the hit sequel “Beverly Hills Cop II,” for which the New York Daily News said, “Gilbert Gottfried steals the picture with a single scene.” On the big screen Gilbert also appeared in “Problem Child’, “Look Who’s Talking II” and “The Aristocrats” where Entertainment Weekly wrote that “out of the 101 comedians who appear on screen, no one is funnier – or more disgusting – than Gilbert Gottfried.”</p><p>After his stellar performance as the wise cracking parrot, IAGO, in the Disney classic “Aladdin,” Gottfried became one of the most recognizable voiceover talents, lending his voice to commercials, cartoons and films, including the PBS Series “Cyberchase.”</p><p>Gottfried made numerous memorable appearances on Comedy Central Roasts and the Comedy Central series, “The Burn with Jeff Ross” and “The Howard Stern Show”. Gottfried’s “Fifty Shades of Grey” reading (College Humor) received over 5 million views on YouTube.</p><p>More recently, in 2017, he was the subject of the documentary “Gilbert,” about his life. He also co-hosted a podcast, “Gilbert Gottfried’s Amazing Colossal Podcast!” on which he and Frank Santopadre interviewed Hollywood icons and legends.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gilbert-gottfried-age></span> Gilbert Gottfried Age<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was born Gilbert Jeremy Gottfried on February 28, 1955 in Brooklyn, New York City, New York.

He wrote: “Gilbert Gottfried made me laugh at times when laughter did not come easily. What a gift. I did not know him well but I loved what he shared with me. My best wishes and sympathy to his family.”</p><p>In January 2022, Gottfried posted a heart-wrenching photo of himself with comedians Bob Saget and Louie Anderson shortly after Louie passed away.

Both good friends that will be missed.”</p><p>Both Saget and Anderson passed away in January 2022: Saget died of an accidental head injury while Anderson succumbed to complications from cancer.</p><p>We at primalinformation.com send our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Cedric McMillan during this difficult time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gilbert-gottfried-cause-of-death></span> Gilbert Gottfried Cause of Death<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gottfried died from recurrent ventricular tachycardia due to myotonic dystrophy type II, a disorder that affects the heart, according to a statement by his publicist and longtime friend Glenn Schwartz to the Associated Press.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gilbert-gottfried-illness></span> Gilbert Gottfried Illness<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Comedian Gilbert Gottfried succumbed to a heart abnormality called recurrent ventricular tachycardia, an arrhythmia caused by myotonic dystrophy type II, according to Glenn Schwartz, his longtime friend and publicist.</p><p>Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a genetic disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting and weakness which predominantly affects the limbs and face but can create increasingly dire complications for respiratory, skeletal and cardiac muscles.</p><p>People with DM are at a higher risk of irregular heartbeat, including ventricular tachycardia, an arrhythmia in the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) that causes the heart to beat faster. A sustained sped-up rhythm can cause a fatal drop in blood pressure.</p><p>Gottfried’s heart condition has been publicly known for some time.
