As fans may remember, the original&nbsp;Good Burger&nbsp;was a huge hit at the box office and developed a cut following in the years after. The film was based on the sketch from&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>All That</a> where two teenagers try to save a burger joint they work at from going out of a business when a competitive burger restaurant opens across the street. A new trailer to get long-time fans excited dropped on Monday, October 30.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>So, what will&nbsp;<i>Good&nbsp;Burger 2&nbsp;</i>be about?

Kel told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> in an <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EXCLUSIVE interview</a> that he and Kenan have “been wanting this to happen since the first one.” Kel added, “But we’ve known about the process of this for a long time. We’re super excited now that the burgers are back and everybody knows what’s happening. It’s going to be a great, great script. That’s the thing that we really wanted. We wanted the script to be fun for the fans of the ’90s and the kids today.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In his <strong>HL</strong> interview, Kel also hinted that most of the other original cast members — which includes&nbsp;<strong>Shar Jackson</strong>,<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Linda Cardellini</strong></a>, <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Shaq</a></strong>, and<strong> Sinbad&nbsp;</strong>— will also be returning. “Oh yeah.

Being a part of something so many generations of people have come to love has made me so proud and now to be back where it all began working on the sequel is surreal!” he said. “Love performing with my brother Kel and can’t wait to show the fans what these characters have been up to since we last saw them.”</p><h3>Crew</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>Good Burger&nbsp;was directed by&nbsp;<strong>Brian Robbins</strong>, but the sequel will be directed by <strong>Phil Traill</strong>. <strong>Kevin Kopelow</strong> and <strong>Heath Seifert</strong>, who co-wrote the original film, are serving as writers and executive producers on the sequel.

In the photos, which you can view below, Kenan rocked street clothes including jeans, a green button up top, and a blue and purple striped shirt underneath. He also wore white sneakers and a mischievous expression.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/good-burger-2-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Kel wore the iconic, unforgettable “Good Burger” uniform of white pants, white service cap, and blue and white striped short sleeved shirt. He finished the memorable look with a black belt and black sneakers and appeared to be waving as he filmed a scene on the street.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/good-burger-2-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>In Aug. 2023, the trailer for Good Burger 2 was released. It shows Kel picking up Kenan in a car while full of high energy. It then shows them and others at the famous restaurant from the film while reciting the famous line, “Welcome to Good Burger, home of the good burger, can we take your order?” Kel is then poured water by a waiter at a sit-down restaurant, in another scene. He hilariously drinks it and spits it back into the pitcher while Kenan says he doesn’t need any. Check out the trailer below.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The teaser for “Good Burger 2” is out <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/IlCnjC491U</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>— philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>August 21, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>The second trailer for&nbsp;Good Burger 2&nbsp;was released on Monday, October 30. The new trailer show new details, including that Ed helped Dex get a new job at the burger chain. Some typical hijinks ensue (like swatting different menu items with a tennis racket or using a plunger to unclog the shake machine), but it also revealed that a new corporation had bought the restaurant to open “Mega Good Burgers” across the country. The duo find out that the company intends to fire all the staff members and replace them with robots.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>Good Burger 2&nbsp;Plot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/good-burger-2-nickelodeon-embed4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15>The original&nbsp;Good Burger&nbsp;ended with Dex and Ed being hailed as heroes, after they saved the Good Burger from going out of business. Ed says the final line of the film, which is, “Welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger. Can I take your order?” We now know that the sequel is taking place in present day, meaning 26 years after the events of the first film.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nickelodeon</a> shared the official longline for&nbsp;The Good Burger 2&nbsp;after the sequel was announced.

With a new crew working at Good Burger, Dex devises a plan to get back on his feet but unfortunately puts the fate of Good Burger at risk once again.” The new trailer revealed that the new movie will also feature the hilarious duo trying to save their jobs from becoming automated as a new company tries to replace all the workers with robots.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Kel teased some of what fans can expect from the sequel in his <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>interview with HL</a>. “Ed is running Good Burger, so that’s going to be awesome. You could imagine how that could go with him running it,” Kel said. “Kenan’s character is going to get Good Burger in a little bit of trouble. That’s literally all I can say.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8aopp1lkqq%2FqLHRZmlmbWBqgXR%2FkGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgood-burger-2-5054331.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgood-burger-2-5054331.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgood-burger-2-5054331.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgood-burger-2-5054331.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgood-burger-2-5054331.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgood-burger-2-5054331.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./joe-manganiello-first-time-no-wedding-ring-public-divorce-sofia-vergara.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./joe-manganiello-first-time-no-wedding-ring-public-divorce-sofia-vergara.html>Joe Manganiello Spotted For First Time Without Wedding Ring After Filing For Divorce From Sofia Verg</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./song-ha-young.html>Song Ha-young Height, Weight, Age, Body Statistics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./song-ha-young.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
