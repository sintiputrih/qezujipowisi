Learn about Gerhard Berger and Ana Corvo.</p><p>Tag along with this article as it covers all the details.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Heidi Berger Parents?</strong></h3><p>Aspiring actress Heidi Berger turned heads after the F1 driver Daniel Ricciardo seemingly confirmed his romance blossoming romance with her. He shared a string of loved-up images with Heidi on his socials. Heidi is the daughter of ten-time Grand Prix winner Gerhard Berger and Portuguese model Ana Corvo. Her parents reportedly met each other at a party in September 1987.</p><p>Currently 24 years old, Heidi’s IMDB page reveals that she has worked on various TV shows such as A Única Mulher, Trakehnerblut, Meiberger: Chasing Minds, Três Mulheres, and Onde Está Elisa? Speaking about her career with CARAS, she revealed that she made a big move from Monaco to Lisbon to further her acting career. She is represented by the talent agencies Buchwald and Conway van Gelder Grant.</p><p>She is popular on her Instagram with 81K followers.</p><p>Let’s focus more on her parents, shall we?</p><h3><strong>Meet Heidi Berger Dad, Gerhard Berger</strong></h3><p>Gerhard Berger, the dad of Heidi Berger, is Austrian by nationality.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Gerhard Berger Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>The date of birth of Gerhard Berger is 27 August 1959. That makes him 62 years old in 2022.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Gerhard Berger Job</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Gerhard Berger is a former driver in Formula One from 1984 to 1997. Berger is one of the most seasoned drivers of all time with 210 starts in Grand Prix. He secured 10 wins. Blooded&nbsp;in the high-stress political milieu of the Ferrari team in the middle of the 1980s, he subsequently had the difficult task of replacing Alain Prost as the renowned Ayrton Senna’s teammate on the McLaren-Honda team at the beginning of 1990.</p><p>This Austrian haulage contractor’s son, who had raced in F3 and toured cars before, entered Formula One in the summer of 1984 while operating an ATS-BMW. He didn’t finish his first race in front of his home fans at the Osterreichring, but he followed it up with a strong sixth place at Monza. However, he was not eligible to get the championship point that normally went along with that finish because he wasn’t a qualified title contender.</p><p>Gerhard raced for the Arrows-BMW team in 1985 before switching to the fledgling Benetton-BMW team in 1986. He won the Mexican Grand Prix and was awarded a three-year Ferrari deal as a result of that victory and several other consistently strong efforts. <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>He left Formula One in 1997, and from 2000 to 2003 he served as the Competitions Director for the BMW Formula One engine supplier.</span></p><p>Gerhard won the Australian GP in Adelaide and the Japanese GP at Suzuka in 1987. In 1988, he became the lone non-McLaren driver to win a race when he beat teammate Michele Alboreto in a fortuitous triumph at Monza.</p><p>Before joining McLaren and spending three years attempting to accept Ayrton Senna as his teammate, he had a disastrous year in 1989, now paired with Nigel Mansell. Berger grew to be one of Ayrton’s closest friends and was never shy about giving the Brazilian his take on anything. It was never going to be simply working with a talent like Senna, but Berger did his best.</p><p>Later on, Gerhard stated in 2006 that he had acquired a 50% share in the brand-new Toro Rosso Formula One team not long after leaving BMW. At the end of 2008, Berger repurchased his ownership stake from co-owner Dietrich Mateschitz.</p><p>In addition, he assumed the role of President of the FIA Single Seat Commission in 2012 and held it until December 2014. Additionally, he presently serves as chair of ITR, the organization that organizes the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters.</p><p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> A Ferrari Testarossa originally supplied to Formula 1 driver Gerhard Berger while he was driving for the Scuderia was auctioned in Monaco in May 2022. Chassis no. ZFFSA17S000080974 was delivered to Berger via the official Ferrari dealership Denzel in Innsbruck, Austria in May 1989, ahead of his final season racing for Ferrari.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Much Is Gerhard Berger Net Worth?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>According to Players Wiki, Gerhard Berger’s net worth is around $18 million.</p><h3><strong>Meet Heidi Berger Mom, Ana Corvo</strong></h3><p>Heidi Berger’s mother is Ana Corvo.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Ana Corvo Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Reportedly born after 1970, Ana Corvo should be at most 52 years old.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Ana Corvo Job</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Former Portuguese model Ana Corvo glistened on the catwalks for numerous years. She must, however, have taken a hiatus from the modeling business after the birth of her daughters in order to care for them. But owing to her youngest daughter, Heidi, who went on to follow in her footsteps, Ana still gets to experience the modeling world and fashion events.</p><p>The rise of fresh talent in the national market is seen by Gerhard’s ex-wife. Additionally, she frequently goes to various events with her daughter.</p><p>In addition, Ana and her two daughters attended L’Agence Go Top Model in Lisbon in November 2016. She discussed her participation in the event and the variations between her era and ours. She gushed about how cute everything was and how, after her absence, it seemed almost like beginning over.</p><p>Ana said that things were a lot smaller, there were no agencies, and the organizations were all different.

She frequently states that she supports whatever her daughters desire to accomplish.</p><p>Ana Corvo also performed on Mundo VIP (1996).</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Much Is Ana Corvo Net Worth?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>In 2022, Ana’s net worth is above $3 million.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Are Heidi Berger Parents Still Married?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Heidi Berger’s parents divorced almost a decade before.
