In our new series How to Make a Movie, some of film’s most accomplished artists from a wide array of fields will be explaining their techniques. <i>The Heat</i>’s Paul Feig will teach you how to whittle down hours of improvised hilarity into one movie. <i>Gravity </i>director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki will give a master class on cinematography through five of his most dazzling shots. Diablo Cody will reveal the five things nobody tells you about being a top screenwriter. Superhero-costume designers, prolific film composers, savvy producers: All week long, they’ll be giving imperative advice on how they do what they do. The series kicks off today with an in-depth interview with Wes Anderson on the making of one of his most beloved films, <i>The Royal Tenenbaums</i>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-985044ed4ab3bb420430de2c4e7e77cf-4-0-0@published data-word-count=115>On Tuesday, <i>New York </i>Magazine TV critic Matt Zoller Seitz will release his sumptuous coffee-table book, <i><a href=#>The Wes Anderson Collection</a></i>. The book delves deeply into each of Anderson’s seven films, dissecting every angle and influence with commentary, illustrations, and photography. Every chapter is anchored by a lengthy conversation between Anderson and Seitz about the making of each film: The <i>Tenenbaums</i> chapter, excerpted here, covers everything from finding the perfect Tenenbaum brownstone to Anderson’s trademark shots to recruiting a reluctant Gene Hackman for the role of reappeared patriarch Royal. Follow Anderson’s lessons to find out how to make a masterpiece of humor and melancholy. (And see a gallery of behind-the-scenes pictures <a href=#>from the Tenenbaums shoot here</a>.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-985044ed4ab3bb420430de2c4e7e77cf-5-0-0@published data-word-count=206><b>Let’s talk about the spaces in The Royal Tenenbaums. Let’s talk about the house. Where is the house? Are the exterior and the interior the same house, or did you shoot those at different places?<br></b>No, it was a real house. At the time I was very adamant that this would be a real place and that we have to make it a real place. The movie’s scheduled around the actors — it’s a little jigsaw puzzle. We have Ben for these three weeks, and we have Gwyneth for only these ten days, and everything is built around that. I felt like they had to have this real place that exists that they can walk into and say, “This is my room. Here’s my room.” And they did. It was also quite practical, I think. The roof was the real roof. It was all one place. The only cheat was with their kitchen, which was in the house next door, because this place had no windows—it was not going to work. But the rest of it’s all there — it’s near Convent Avenue and 144th Street in Harlem, just north of City College. The hotel where Gene Hackman is living at the beginning is the Waldorf.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-985044ed4ab3bb420430de2c4e7e77cf-6-0-0@published data-word-count=156><b>Were there any places in the movie that were wholly invented, where you built a set? Did you build any sets?<br></b>Well, let’s see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no. You know, we built the archaeological site, but they’ve had plenty of those in the city. Everything’s kind of inspired by something, and everything’s done in some converted place. For the 375th Street Y, the exterior was in one place on the Upper East Side, and for the interior we found a place in New Jersey. I can’t remember where. I can’t remember what it’s called, but somewhere in Newark there was this big abandoned hospital, and we made our hospital in it. We also found a mansion in Yonkers that we used for many things—Gwyneth in Paris in one little corner, the bathroom of Gwyneth and Bill’s apartment in another, and Gene’s doctor’s office in another. But anyway, the 375th Street Y—the place where they lived—that was in New Jersey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ffd/b68/0099f30d2748f546e3495657dce8390e0d-critics-portraits-0013-MattZollerSeitzFI.2x.rsquare.w168.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-985044ed4ab3bb420430de2c4e7e77cf-8-0-0@published data-word-count=236><b>Talk to me about Orson Welles and The Magnificent Ambersons. That house looks an awful lot like the Ambersons’ house, and I’m assuming that’s just a lucky accident.<br></b>Well, a lucky accident, but probably also because it was in my mind. The Royal Tenenbaums was really inspired by The Magnificent Ambersons more than anything, but it’s the one film I haven’t even thought to mention so far. But yes, I found the house with my friend George Drakoulias.<span class=correctionMarker>*</span> We were driving around, and one other person was with us, my assistant Will Sweeney. And George was on the phone, and we were walking around an area in New York called Hamilton Heights, and George said, “I think you might look up the street. There’s a place up there.” And I walked up there, and what I probably saw was a house that looked just like the one in Ambersons, and I thought, “That’s the place.” And I also saw a sign in the window that said it had just been foreclosed on, so I thought, “Well, what state is this going to be in?” What happened was that a guy had just bought it after it was foreclosed on for the amount that we ended up paying him to use it. He got the house, ultimately, at no cost, because our fees for shooting there ended up being the equivalent of what he paid for it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-985044ed4ab3bb420430de2c4e7e77cf-9-0-0@published data-word-count=17><b>He had a very good year.

Anyway, that’s the milieu.<b></b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-985044ed4ab3bb420430de2c4e7e77cf-12-0-0@published data-word-count=115><b>Do you remember the first Orson Welles film that you saw?<br></b>I think it might have been Touch of Evil or The Lady from Shanghai. Even before I saw Citizen Kane, I think I might have seen those. He’s always been one of my very favorite directors. I love The Trial, and I love Anthony Perkins in The Trial. The Trial is fantastic, and very underrated. It’s a part of Welles’s European phase, when he was having trouble getting money together, and one of the things that’s fascinating about it is that you can kind of see the production disintegrating as it goes along, as if the money is running out on-screen as you watch.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-985044ed4ab3bb420430de2c4e7e77cf-13-0-0@published data-word-count=61>I think originally they were going to shoot the entire thing on sets.

Part of how I would communicate with the animators, and with the director of animation, was to make little videos, but it wasn’t meant to be a performance. It was just meant to communicate certain things that the puppets could do. But sometimes a gesture is hard to describe. You have to sort of do it for people. If the gesture is like, “I’ll meet you on the other side,” I could show them a gesture that means that a bit more easily than if we sat there talking about it until we both figured out that we were talking about the same thing.<i></i></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-985044ed4ab3bb420430de2c4e7e77cf-20-0-0@published data-word-count=71><b>Have you ever studied acting?<br></b>I was interested in acting when I was a teenager.

When Mr. Wilson got there, what he saw was that Luke was one of the most popular kids in the school, that he was kind of a hero in the school — but Luke just didn’t feel that appreciation I guess. He didn’t want to be there. He was sad there, and he was homesick, and he didn’t want to be there. And that kind of combination, that’s very unusual. He’s a very charismatic person, and he certainly doesn’t wear his heart on his sleeve.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-985044ed4ab3bb420430de2c4e7e77cf-88-0-0@published data-word-count=100><b>He’s walking around like a ghost in this movie.
