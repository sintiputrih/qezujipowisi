George Holliday’s 1991 ten-minute videotape of the Rodney King beating was included as an artwork, and one of the biennial’s admission buttons, designed by artist Daniel J. Martinez, famously read I CAN’T IMAGINE EVER WANTING TO BE WHITE.</p><h2 class=related-stories-title data-editable=title>Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-rIf1s54l"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>Can the Art World Take James Franco Seriously?</span></a> <a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-k56LnGvp"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>David Hockney Talks Mass Appeal, Virtual Reality, and Lost Bohemia</span></a> <a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-0fNNDvsA"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>Is Richard Prince the Andy Warhol of Instagram?</span></a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh1zu7xd002j3k62qhab5y9w@published data-word-count=159>What followed was war: white-male critics gone wild. The&nbsp;Times’ Michael Kimmelman&nbsp;<a href=#>opined</a>, “I hate the show,” blasting the art as “grim,” “political sloganeering and self-indulgent self-expression.” Robert Hughes said the show was “a fiesta of whining” and “preachy and political.”&nbsp;Newsweekdetected the “aroma of cultural reparations.” Jed Perl thought the show was calculated to get “white male critics into … [a] sweat of guilt and remorse and accommodation.” Hilton Kramer — referring to the biennial’s one African-American curator, Thelma Golden — said there was an “awful logic in having Ms. Golden on the curatorial team.” Even&nbsp;The Village Voiceraged that the art was angry, portentous, condescending, groaningly didactic, hateful. I was then still driving a long-distance truck and only wrote about the biennial in a now-defunct magazine. Political but no firebrand, I nevertheless suspected that the show was important precisely because of the vehemence of the art-world rejection. I quoted James Baldwin, saying that “the rage of the disesteemed” was upon us.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh1zv76800323k62urezxbop@published data-word-count=80>Amazingly, it looks like I was right about those critics. Just as amazingly, they were right about the show. Art did change! So did everything! Look around. We are living in a moment of white rage (“Make America Hate Again”), and what white America is angry about is the loss of its monopoly ownership of American culture. The story is the same in art: That biennial marked the effective end of visual culture’s being mainly white, Western, straight, and male.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh1zv8ls00383k62sryp7mwa@published data-word-count=94>And yet the transformation unleashed by the culture wars is not just about representation, diversity, numbers, and good little humanists wagging self-righteous fingers. It’s about the way culture is formed, how art is made — and what counts as art. For the first time, biography, history, the plight of the marginalized, institutional politics, context, sociologies, anthropologies, and privilege have all been recognized as “forms,” “genres,” and “materials” in art. Possibly the core materials. That shift put the artistic self front and center, making it perhaps the primary carrier of artistic content since the 1990s.</p><h2 class=related-stories-title data-editable=title>Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-3loKYtHP"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>Tour Vito Schnabel’s Art-Packed Palazzo Chupi Apartment</span></a> <a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-m6mh0wic"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>Inside a Pesce-Heavy Park Avenue Apartment</span></a> <a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-KRKOiVxv"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>A Central Park Duplex With a Calder in the Trees</span></a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh1zv8lt00393k62vqwwpgzv@published data-word-count=139>We’ve been living so long now in a culture of self-assertion that it may be hard to remember just how new this spirit is. The Impressionists were not overtly making work about “identity” or “the self”; nor were the Cubists, or the Fauvists. The entire engine of modernism, while powered by larger-than-life artistic personalities, subjugated art to work that was primarily “about” form and technique. Fast-forward to the postwar period, and the story is the same: Think of the grandiose universality of Mark Rothko’s Abstract Expressionism or Richard Serra’s and Carl Andre’s materialistic minimalisms. We think we know these artists by looking at their work, and we do; but the work is not about who they are. Even Warhol said, “If you want to know all about Andy Warhol, just look at the surface … There’s nothing behind it.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh1zv8lu003a3k62yeqp3c5c@published data-word-count=272>To be sure, this new transformation had roots going further back than the 1990s, especially among artists, who for decades were actively preoccupied with politics, black power, women’s liberation, gay liberation, and more. Warhol’s swishiness was revolutionary; so was Lynda Benglis posing naked with a double-headed dildo and Cindy Sherman disappearing into her film stills. But the culture-wars era, which ran roughly from 1989 to the late 1990s, brought the whole struggle to the foreground. In that period I remember seeing Kara Walker’s first cut-out panoramas of antebellum black horror at the Drawing Center and knowing that a new American Goya was unleashed;&nbsp;<a href=#>Chris Ofili’s glittery, dotted, day-glo colored paintings</a>&nbsp;with elephant dung of the Virgin Mary were wildly irrational, beautiful, shamanic. Shirin Neshat created melodramatic formal films of a modern Arab world on the edge of crisis. Glenn Ligon made paintings of fraying texts from Baldwin that melted in viewers consciousness like superheated political plasma. Video artist Steve McQueen, who won the Academy Award for&nbsp;<a href=#>12 Years a Slave</a>,&nbsp;made enigmatic videos of what looked like a dead black body on a morgue table. Wael Shawky made old Italian puppets tell the story of the crusades from the Islamic point of view.&nbsp; Rirkrit Tiravanija served free Thai food to visitors in museums and galleries. It wasn’t just a new genre for the disenfranchised, either:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>white male identity was plumbed, as well, in epic operatic films of Matthew Barney dancing as a genital-less satyr. More recently, we’ve gotten<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the insane overload of sound, color, sensibilities, cults and tribes in Ryan Trecartin and Lizzie Fitch’s videos and the JPEG,&nbsp;YouTube&nbsp;circularity data in Hito Steyerl’s walk-in videos, films and sculptural installations.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh1zv8lv003b3k62ajibsrrb@published data-word-count=160>After the ’80s, we seem to have lost the reflex to recognize or name new art movements — maybe because in the sprawling new art ecology there were so many isms sprouting at once; plus we’ve always categorized things by formal, medium-based, and geographical attributes. But something has happened here, over the last 25 years, that I am sure will be recognized with great clarity by art-history students very soon. Art in this era has veered dramatically toward an approach that hasn’t been seen in the West for more than 1,000 years: a concerted urge, almost a rage, to be totally communicative to the largest possible audiences, addressing cognoscenti, novices, and newcomers in the same register, telling stories of social, political, and philosophical conditions. Of course, not everybody today is making this kind of work. But taken together, it does constitute a real aesthetic movement, one that is biographical, autobiographical, personal — the art of the first person.&nbsp;— Jerry Saltz</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><span class="yr yr-1991">1984</span> <span class="yr yr-today">Today</span><p><span>1984-1991</span> <span>The beginning, really, is AIDS.</span></p><p><span>1989</span> <span>The Establishment doesn’t love that stuff …</span></p><p><span>1989–1990</span> <span>… But the art world won’t back down.</span></p><p><span>1990</span> <span>(Nor will right-wing standard-bearers.)</span></p><p><span>1990</span> <span>The New Art is immediate, political.</span></p><p><span>1990</span> <span>Carrie Mae Weems puts the black female experience in front of the camera.</span></p><p><span>1991</span> <span>Glenn Ligon makes idiosyncratic annotations of older artwork.</span></p><p><span>1991</span> <span>Felix Gonzalez-Torres and Rirkrit Tiravanija make art so intimate you can eat it.</span></p><p><span>1991</span> <span>David Hammons becomes the movement’s godfather.</span></p><p><span>1991</span> <span>Artists make work explicitly about exclusion …</span></p><p><span>1991</span> <span>… And place that art right where the public can see it.</span></p><p><span>1993</span> <span>The Whitney Biennial breaks the Levee.</span></p><p><span>1993</span> <span>Critics can’t stand it.</span></p><p><span>1993</span> <span>Especially Hated Are the Daniel J.Martinez–Designed Buttons.</span></p><p><span>1993</span> <span>Even the show’s curator is stunned by the response.</span></p><p><span>1993-1999</span> <span>Identity Floods Into the Art World</span></p><p><span>1994</span> <span>Artists pick up the gauntlet.</span></p><p><span>1994</span> <span>Then, the world is introduced to Kara Walker.</span></p><p><span>1995</span> <span>And the shock-and-awe biennial model gets exported.</span></p><p><span>1990s</span> <span>And artists of color finally find galleries to call home.</span></p><p><span>1990s</span> <span>This is no paradise of inclusion — particularly for women and Latino artists.</span></p><p><span>1994–1999</span> <span>But art institutions are taking note.</span></p><p><span>1998</span> <span>As are art critics.</span></p><p><span>1999</span> <span>And when Rudy Giuliani launches his crusade against this painting, it marks the end of the culture war …</span></p><p><span>1999</span> <span>… With art values victorious.</span></p><p><span>2001–2016</span> <span>The Theater of the Self is Born</span></p><p><span>2001</span> <span>Golden asks: Can black art move past multiculturalism?</span></p><p><span>2002</span> <span>And other doors crack open …</span></p><p><span>2003</span> <span>… Giving way to a whole new genre — performing who you are.</span></p><p><span>2000s</span> <span>Even art by white men starts to look different.</span></p><p><span>2000s</span> <span>The Establishment really begins buying in.</span></p><p><span>2008</span> <span>This often still means support from white patrons.</span></p><p><span>2000s</span> <span>Though some icons of diversity resist being labeled.</span></p><p><span></span> <span>And wonder just what can be achieved.</span></p><p><span>2010-2015</span> <span>With social media, artists can now speak even more directly …</span></p><p><span>2011–2014</span> <span>… And sell and market work themselves.</span></p><p><span>2000s</span> <span>IRL artists carry the activist torch</span></p><p><span>2000s</span> <span>And the signs of revolution are everywhere.</span></p><p><span>Today</span> <span>As are the arguments.</span></p><p><span>Today</span> <span>Which makes first-person art, undeniably, an art-historical movement – the movement of our time.</span></p><p class="clay-paragraph-designed tm-entry" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph-designed/instances/cjh2a34dq00163k6512831zbw@published><strong>THE BEGINNING, REALLY, IS AIDS.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh2aagap00163k65avxccfzj@published data-word-count=1>1984-1991</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh2aahkr001d3k653kkynk7u@published data-word-count=99>In the Reagan ’80s, photographers like Nan Goldin and Robert Mapplethorpe document a demimonde that looks like it might go extinct.

Michael Kimmelman writes in the first paragraph of his New York&nbsp;<a href=#>Times</a>&nbsp;review: “It has brought various New York critics of usually discordant opinions into rare harmony: at the least, they dislike it. I hate the show.” Robert Hughes’s&nbsp;<a href=#>Time</a>&nbsp;review was subtitled “A Fiesta of Whining.” Peter Schjeldahl of&nbsp;The Village Voice&nbsp;says the show “really may have been the worst ever.” “The show was rough and vulgar,” says Schjeldahl now. “I reacted against that. I resisted the truth that it embodied a necessary force of history, squaring the little art world with big values of democracy. But truth will tell, and I came around. Art survived just fine. The event was good for society and, gradually, by the way, for me.” Michael Kimmelman is less contrite: “My 93 piece in retrospect seems to me heartfelt and clear,” he says. “It’s not against the idea of a more politically engaged biennial or art world, but against the specifics of that show. Politics matter.”</p><p class="clay-paragraph-designed tm-entry" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph-designed/instances/cjh2aiheo006d3k652i78elfl@published>Especially Hated Are the Daniel J.Martinez–Designed Buttons.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh2aonj500ce3k65vl6c319r@published data-word-count=1>1993</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ba7/b3b/cd40a762bb853b0152f9598d1fea4430ee-19-identity-tag.rsquare.w190.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh2apes200cz3k6558vsvv3p@published data-word-count=140>Martinez, an L.A. multimedia artist, has already been making provocative, politically charged art before being tapped to make the entry buttons for the show. “Before the tags I had all kinds of museums and galleries wanting me to do shows,” he says. “Then the biennial happened and I couldn’t buy a show. No one would touch me. The tags themselves are completely misunderstood. Arthur Danto was beside himself with anger. Like most white people, he didn’t know what to do with it. People started every article saying, ‘Daniel Martinez is a reverse racist’ and I was like, ‘That’s the best you got?!’ I relish anyone with an intellect who is really willing to do the work, but instead what you got was a bunch of responses from people I wouldn’t even ask to pick the colored towels in my bathroom.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh2apfws00d93k6561b0z2zu@published data-word-count=141>My piece in particular completely changed the identity of the Whitney Museum. They were never able to go back the same way because it had altered its institutional profile. We believed the battle had been won. We thought that if you could have the Whitney commit its resources to [this conversation] then it only seemed logical that everyone would follow suit.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We didn’t think the reaction would be, ‘this is the worst thing that ever happened.’ It should’ve been a cue to anyone that art could be richer, more fantastic, and why would anybody want less? Instead the response was the most neo-con reaction possible. There were 800 or 900 reviews written and they were basically like, ‘Who let the queers and minorities into the museum?’ instead of embracing a reality of inevitability in this country. We were wrong. We were wrong.”</p><p class="clay-paragraph-designed tm-entry" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph-designed/instances/cjh2anpak00b63k657ihfmj80@published>Even the show’s curator is stunned by the response.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh2aq51h00dq3k65iutpm02r@published data-word-count=1>1993</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh2aq6j300dz3k657n7qf9xi@published data-word-count=249>“By the end of the 1980s, anyone who was working as a curator knew they had to bust out of the white ghetto,” says Sussman. “But these were arguments contained at the margins, not the center of the art world, and I’d consider the Whitney the center.” Inspired by downtown spaces like Kenkeleba House, the New Museum, and Exit Art, Sussman works directly with collectors, curators, and artists, rather than galleries, to find new voices that hadn’t yet been screened by the market. “It was absolutely important to take on what I, as the lead curator, thought was the most important thing happening at that moment in America,” she says. “Biennials are always controversial; you know that going into it. But I certainly did not expect it to this extent. The reviews were very aggressive. It was Kimmelman who really got the argument up to the high decibel, and he was a new critic at that time. It was like a field day for critics. I didn’t go to the board meetings, but I felt as staff that I had to be protected in some way. These were not easy times.” But the show changes things, for sure. “I think it’s taken for granted now that biennials will take a political position. It’s almost a cliché now. They’re now seen as a platform for diversity and progressive thinking — if they don’t do that then it seems like they haven’t done their job. That wasn’t the case before 1993.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8b4/41a/66b6bca9895bfaca89d7d5e32d63372c16-19-identity-what-you-lookin-at.w710.jpg><p class="clay-paragraph-designed tm-entry" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph-designed/instances/cjh2annqb00av3k65jkhx1e0r@published><strong>IDENTITY FLOODS INTO THE ART WORLD</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh2an3le009m3k651kbe06re@published data-word-count=1>1993–1999</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh2aqz3200eg3k65cqsuktv6@published data-word-count=185>Led by Thelma Golden, the 1993 biennial’s one black curator. Golden is not yet 30 when she curates “Black Male” at the Whitney, which features work by Fred Wilson, Adrian Piper, Leon Golub, and Barkley L.

It was such an unforgettable, generation-defining exhibition. Step into any American museum today, and you will see the imprint of the show everywhere.

I recall that weeks went by before she called us back and said she could do it. The work she presented in our exhibition was extraordinary, shocking, and intensely confrontational on the issue of race.

The political edge of black art doesn’t have to be there anymore for the work to be authentic. But what is that really about? A certain part of it is complacency that comes from economic well-being.

Glenn Ligon’s “America”&nbsp;<a href=#>retrospective</a>&nbsp;opens at the Whitney. Megagallery Hauser Wirth & Schimmel inaugurates its mammoth L.A. space showcasing 50 years of female sculptors, and Jack Shainman opens two new gallery spaces. The first show composed entirely of black artists goes on view at Yale, M.F.A. student Awol Erizku’s “13 Artists.” (“It was not an initiative of the faculty; the students did it because they weren’t getting what they wanted,” says Rob Storr, then the dean of Yale’s art school. “Faculties are not diverse. They’re not entirely monochrome, but they’re overwhelmingly monochrome.”) The ambassador to South Africa is trying to bring “30 Americans” to Johannesburg, says Mera Rubell. The Brooklyn Museum mounts a&nbsp;<a href=#>Kehinde Wiley</a>&nbsp;retrospective. (“It was my awakening moment,” says Kimberly Drew. “I felt something happening in me — there was a considerable shift. I’d been coming to museums throughout my life and I had never seen anything like that before. Just being in that room and seeing people that looked like me was incredibly profound and moving.”) Frank Benson’s sculpture of Juliana Huxtable’s nude, transgender body becomes one of the most-talked-about works in the New Museum Triennial. The Whitney calls the major exhibition, drawn from its own collection, with which it opened its new building, “America is Hard to See.”</p><p class="clay-paragraph-designed tm-entry" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph-designed/instances/cjh2bdxc4010h3k65j3vyea2v@published>As are the arguments.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh2bg3xp012n3k65kdlv5hbr@published data-word-count=1>Today</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh2bg69m012w3k653jm86742@published data-word-count=115>When in 2014 white artist Joe Scanlan introduces a character played by a black woman into the Whitney Biennial, the mostly queer and black Yams Collective withdraws from the show. “We are protesting institutional white supremacy and how it plays out,” a Yams member told Artnet News. “A main part of our message is that we want to move the idea of white supremacy away from caricatures of white supremacy: neo-Nazis, KKK members, crazy kids who live in the mountains of Arkansas. White supremacy is embodied in these institutions that tokenize us, that invite us into spaces where they have absolutely no interest in ceding power. That’s the most important thing to get about this.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh2bg69n012x3k65zk5pxhxh@published data-word-count=214>Unsurprisingly, Scanlan sees himself working in pursuit of the same values. “Donelle&nbsp;Woolford springs from the fact that, while museums have made great strides in expanding the points of view in their programming, there is still an expectation that in order for artists of color to gain access they have to make work about their identities,” he says. “That is, requires them to demonstrate they’re authentic. This was and remains a kind of trap that disciplines all artists who&nbsp;don’t make work about their identities and constrains those artists who do. Even when an artist of color plays with this authenticity and control — say Adrian Piper or Pope.L — their actual identities are still used as proof of a momentary, but authentic achievement of diversity. We wanted to see what would happen if a character like Donelle&nbsp;Woolford entered this system, what would happen when her identity was revealed to be performed, inauthentic.&nbsp;Needless to say, her presence has been transformative. The protest and withdrawal by the Yams Collective wouldn’t have been effective without the catalysis of&nbsp;Donelle&nbsp;Woolford. The same is true for all museums and curators who now feel compelled to take their commitments to access seriously. As&nbsp;Marcel Broodthaers said, ‘Fiction enables us to grasp reality and, at the same time, that which is veiled by reality.’”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh2bg69p012y3k6514081ce6@published data-word-count=80>“We are at an interesting moment in America today,” says Okwui Enwezor. “One that I believe is quite analogous to what has been termed the ‘heyday’ of identity politics in the late 1980s and 1990s. This in my view is very welcome, particularly in the way different forms of engaged art and activism bring a spotlight to the types of clueless and insipid formalism that was running amok in galleries and museums recently in the name of a revitalized painting.”</p><p class="clay-paragraph-designed tm-entry" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph-designed/instances/cjh2bfm7501263k6501fz3dr9@published>Which makes first-person art, undeniably, an art-historical movement – the movement of our time.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh2b86x800vw3k658sx62zqw@published data-word-count=1>Today</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjh2bglgi013c3k65cja6z9n5@published data-word-count=47>Jerry Saltz: “Artists now work at the scale of medieval cathedral façades, meant to tell universal stories in highly accessible ways.
