<time>21 Jan 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>After more than 11 years of multiple wins on the PGA Tour, Jason Day still feels underwhelmed.&nbsp;He achieved World No. 1 status and played on four Presidential Cup teams.&nbsp;In an interview with&nbsp;</span><span>Golfwold</span><span>&nbsp;Brain Wacker, published October 11, 2018, Day admitted that his accomplishments and achievements lagged behind those of Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy, who ruled the world of golf for 13 years.</span></p><p><span>Maybe he’s just humble and unassuming, there are plenty of golfers who will do anything to be where he is.&nbsp;Here’s the life of former World No. 1 golfer Jason Day.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Jason Days Bio, Ethnicity</span></strong></h2><p><span>Born in Beaudesert town in the scenic region of Queensland, Australia in November 1987, the Australian golf professional and PGA member’s father is Irish Australian and his mother is a Filipina who emigrated to Australia in the early 1980’s.&nbsp;The day’s interest in golf began at a golf club near him when he enrolled as a junior member.&nbsp;By the age of 8, when his family moved to Rockhampton, Jason was already winning at various events.&nbsp;Jason Day identifies as a multi-ethnic Australian.</span></p><p><span>Day had his first major win when he was 13, winning the 2000 Australian Masters Junior Event at the Gold Coast City of Australia.&nbsp;He won Australia’s Junior Order of Merit twice as an amateur and was 7th leading amateur at the Queensland Open.&nbsp;Day went to the US and competed in the 2004 Callaway World Junior Championships.&nbsp;He was runner-up at the 2005 Porter Cup and was also runner-up on the Australian national golf team.</span></p><p><span>His professional career began in July 2006, the same year that he was endorsed by&nbsp;</span><span>Bespoke</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Adidas</span><span>&nbsp;and began competing in the PGA Tour competitions.&nbsp;In 2007 he set a new record as the youngest player to win 3 PGA tours in the Legend Financial Group Classics.</span></p><span>By May 2010, Jason Day became the youngest Australian to win a PGA event when he won the HP Byron Nelson Championship.&nbsp;When pro golfer Greg Norman retired, Day had the opportunity to compete in his first Open Championship.&nbsp;He won his first world title in February 2014 in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship against Frenchman Victor Dubuisson.&nbsp;With this win, the tag ranked 4th in the world.&nbsp;He defeated American B. Holmes to win the Farmers Insurance Open in February 2015.</span><p><span>The day broke during the 2015 US Open due to dizziness.&nbsp;He was too weak to play the next day and finished the third round in 9th place.&nbsp;After recovering, Jason Day continued his winning streak and became the #1 Barclays and BMW Championships on September 20, 2015.&nbsp;on September 13, 2017.</span></p><p><span>In January 2018, he went home with the Farmer Insurance Open title for the second time in his career after beating Ryan Palmer by sudden death in the play-offs.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jason Day was Forbes’ Richest Golfer of 2016, and currently has a net worth of $40 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.&nbsp;The total is an incredible sum that he has gleaned from his golfing career and various endorsement deals he has enjoyed over time.</span></p><h2><strong><span>family – mother</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jason Day’s mother battled lung cancer.&nbsp;She kept it away from her family for a while, but Jason found out and almost gave up his career while taking care of his mother.&nbsp;Thankfully, she underwent successful lung cancer surgery in March 2017 and survived the ordeal.</span></p><h2><strong><span>wife and son</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jason Day is married to Ellie Harvey.&nbsp;The couple met at a restaurant in Ohio where Elle worked as a waitress and married in 2009.&nbsp;On December 17, 2915, Ellie, wife of Jason Day, was injured during a basketball game when then-Cleveland Cavaliers player LeBron James fell on her while she was sitting in the front row of the court watching the game.&nbsp;She was pulled from the game and hospitalized.</span></p><p><span>Jason and Ellie have two children.&nbsp;A son, Dash, who was born in 2012, and a daughter, Lucy, born in November 2015. The couple lost a baby after Ellie suffered a miscarriage on December 12, 2017.&nbsp;This hasn’t diminished the love Jason Day has for his beautiful wife one bit.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Aussie golfer is 6ft (1.83m) tall which is a good thing as it gives him buoyancy across the field for his long swings, in addition to helping his 88kg weight stabilize his frame.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><span class=vce-square></span><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# title="Who is Cassandra Marino?
