He was doing improv in Chicago, IL at the time and the two hit it off. They ended up dating for several years and one year after he was hired as a writer for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Saturday Night Live</a>, they tied the knot in 2004. Jason had to spend time away from Kay in New York City, NY, where the SNL studios were located, and he later opened up about how he eventually approached <strong>Lorne Michaels</strong> for a job as a cast member.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He had the best line. I go, ‘I had to give up two things I love the most to take this writing job: performing and living with my wife.’ And on a dime, he just goes, ‘Well, if you had to choose&nbsp;one … ‘ ” Jason said in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GQ </a>in 2021.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>He became a cast member and a few years later, his marriage with Kay stopped working. He also talked about how that situation was and how it affected his work, in the open and honest GQ interview. “You’re going through something emotionally and personally, or even professionally if that’s affecting you personally, and then you’re dressed up like&nbsp;<strong>George Bush</strong> and you’re live on television for eight minutes. You feel like a crazy person. You feel absolutely crazy. You’re looking at yourself in the mirror and you’re just like, ‘Who am I? What is this? Holy hell,'” he explained.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Jason and Kay went their separate ways in 2008 but their divorce wasn’t finalized until 2010. They still remain friendly and after Jason’s Golden Globe Award win in 2021, Kay even shared a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>message of support</a> on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a>. “A lifetime ago, I spent several years watching the #goldenglobes w/ @jasonsudeikis while he was high & wearing a hoodie. Congrats on your win, ya wanker! And congrats to the cast & crew of @TedLasso . Such a great, funny & heartfelt show. #believe,” she wrote.</p><h2>January Jones</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jason-Sudeikis-Relationships-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>After Jason’s marriage with Kay didn’t work out, he went on to reportedly date actress <strong>January Jones</strong>. They were first seen together at an ESPY afterparty in July 2010 and were later seen on set of a movie Jason was filming at the time. They were also <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photographed</a> grabbing lunch together in Los Angeles, CA around the same time. After sparking romance rumors, Jason confirmed their relationship, in an interview on Lopez Tonight, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Huffington Post</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Despite having a “great” time together, Jason and January called it quits in Jan. 2011. After reportedly being “on and off” for a few months, sources said that distance was the reason things didn’t work out.</p><h2>Olivia Wilde</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jason-Sudeikis-Relationships-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>After his time with January, Jason went on to meet Olivia at a SNL afterparty in 2011. Olivia admitted she was “there as a date of someone else,” during an interview on The Howard Stern Show. “I was looking for this person, and [Jason] said, ‘Whatever you’re looking for, you don’t need it.’ But he claims — he’s like, ‘It was true, it wasn’t a line!’,” she explained. He ended up walking away without getting her number, but they later kept bumping into each other at various events over the course of six months and Olivia eventually asked her best guy friend to give her number to Jason. It led to their first date, which was at a restaurant in New York City, in the fall of 2011, and it grew from there.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In Oct. 2013, Jason and Olivia announced that they were expecting their first child and they got engaged after he proposed to her just a few months later. Their son, <strong>Otis Alexander</strong>, was born in Apr. 2014 and he was followed by their daughter, <strong>Daisy Josephine</strong> in Oct. 2016. Despite being open about their love for each other throughout the years, the lovebirds ended their engagement and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>went their separate ways</a> in Nov. 2020, just short of their 10-year anniversary as a couple.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>After their split, Jason and Olivia went through a custody battle for their two children. Olivia was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>served with legal documents</a> concerning the matter during an appearance at CinemaCon in Las Vegas, NV in 2022. Although they continue to work out arrangements, Olivia said that their children are and always will be their number one priority and they both just want what’s best for them.</p><h2>Keeley Hazell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jason-Sudeikis-Relationships-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Seven months after Jason’s split from Olivia, he was seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>packing on PDA</a> with his Ted Lasso co-star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Keeley</strong> <strong>Hazell</strong></a>, whom he first met while filming Horrible Bosses 2 seven years prior. They were also seen kissing during a trip to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico in Nov. 2021, and were first linked in Feb. 2021, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>US Weekly</a>. A source told the outlet that they started out as “just friends” but it turned romantic shortly after Jason was single again. Sadly, the couple didn’t last, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>called it quits</a> in May 2022. After their split, they <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>made headlines</a> when they both attended the premiere of the final season of Ted Lasso in Mar. 2023, but they did not pose together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8maqqimXajCpbHIpKCsZaees6Z5lGlsaW1obHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjason-sudeikis-wife-5050587.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjason-sudeikis-wife-5050587.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjason-sudeikis-wife-5050587.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjason-sudeikis-wife-5050587.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjason-sudeikis-wife-5050587.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjason-sudeikis-wife-5050587.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./729872-latto-sexy-photos-boyfriend-posting-approval-hip-hop-news.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./729872-latto-sexy-photos-boyfriend-posting-approval-hip-hop-news.html>Latto Sends Her Sultry Pics To Her Man Before Posting For Approval, She Reveals</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./movie-review-sean-penn-and-dakota-johnson-in-daddio-html.html>Dakota Johnson Is Actually Great in Daddio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./movie-review-sean-penn-and-dakota-johnson-in-daddio-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
