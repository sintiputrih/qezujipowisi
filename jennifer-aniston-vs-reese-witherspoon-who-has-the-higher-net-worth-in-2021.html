The actresses both produce the show as well as star in it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Witherspoon and Aniston may be two of the biggest names in Hollywood, there is no bad blood between the two. In fact, <a href=#>they are really close friends</a> and like working together.</p><p>The best friends have acted in some things together and earned an <a href=#>impressive net worth.</a> So, who has the higher net worth in 2021? The answer may shock you. Let's take a look at their careers and where they are today.</p><h2 id=how-they-met><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>How They Met</span></h2><p>In an interview with Harper's Bazaar, Witherspoon said that the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> first time they met was on the set of Friends.</a> "We met on the set of Friends; I played her sister. I was 23-years-old and had just had a baby." Witherspoon was in awe of her acting abilities. "She was so sweet to me. I was really nervous, and she was like, 'Oh, my goshâ€”don't worry about it!' I marveled at her ability to perform in front of a live audience like that with no nerves."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Christina Applegate was added as a sister after there were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors that Aniston and Witherspoon didn't get along</a>. However, that turned out not to be true. So, Rachel wound up having two sisters because of the fight rumors. They actually struck up a close relationship, playing sisters which has lasted to this day. They currently star on The Morning Show together.</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-39-s-career><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jennifer Aniston's Career</span></h2><p>She starred in a number of roles before Friends, but the sitcom is what skyrocketed her to fame and earned her the money that she has now. <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong> is also known for her roles in The Morning Show, Just Go With it, Horrible Bosses and its sequel, The Break-Up, We're The Millers, He's Just Not That Into You and so much more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From Friends alone, she has made most of her money. In season one, she made $22,500 per episode. By then time season 5 rolled around, she was earning $100,00 per episode and by the last two seasons, $1,000,000. And she is still earning from reruns, having received 2 percent of the show's annual syndication income, reportedly making $20 million each from residuals. Each cast member reportedly earned <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$2.5 million from the reunion,</a> according to Variety. Currently, Aniston earns about $1.2 million per episode for The Morning Show.</p><h2 id=reese-witherspoon-39-s-career><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Reese Witherspoon's Career</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Witherspoon didn't get her start on a successful sitcom, she made a great career for herself in films. After appearing on Friends, Witherspoon went on to star in her break-out role, <a href=#>Legally Blonde</a><a href=#> and its sequel</a>, Sweet Home Alabama, Walk The Line, Four Christmases, A Wrinkle In Time and so much more.

So you would think a lot of her money would be gone from that, but that's not actually the case. When Aniston was married to <strong><a href=#>Brad Pitt</a></strong>, <a href=#>they did not sign a prenup.</a> They divorced in 2005, and since they married in California, the law dictated that she would get 50 percent Pitt's earnings and assets that he earned during their marriage. At that time, he was worth more than her. However, she was not interested in his money and got to keep their $29 million home and a stake in their production company, Plan B Productions.</p><p>Now, for her second divorce from Justin Theroux, they did sign a prenup, according to Us Weekly. However, Theroux was not interested in taking her money since he has his own. It was rumored that she sold their Beverly Hills mansion, which was worth $23 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Best Reese Witherspoon Movies, Officially Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-did-reese-witherspoon-earn-from-her-divorce><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Much Did Reese Witherspoon Earn From Her Divorce?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reese Witherspoon has also been divorced before. She and actor Ryan Phillipe married in the early 2000s and divorced in 2007. However, they earned a bit of money from their split. In 2014, they finally sold their shared duplex in Los Angeles. They sold it for $1,440,00 and earned $266,500 profit from it, in which they had to split. The couple never signed a prenup, so she requested that the court should refuse to give Phillippe spousal support. She did not seek any spousal support either. Their debate was more of the custody of their children, in which they share joint custody.</p><h2 id=hello-sunshine-productions><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Hello Sunshine Productions</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Witherspoon developed a production company, Hello Sunshine, back in 2016 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly sold it to another company this past August.</a> A Blackstone-backed media company purchased a majority stake in Hello Sunshine for $900 million. The company, which is now run by former Disney execs Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, has produced shows such as The Morning Show, Big Little Lies and Little Fires Everywhere.</p><p>She will retain 18 percent ownership stake and will collect $120 million, after taxes, from the sale of the company, in which she used to own 40 percent. Before Hello Sunshine, the company was called Pacific Standard and produced Wild and Gone Girl.</p><h2 id=aniston-39-s-endorsements><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Aniston's Endorsements</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with acting and producing, Aniston endorsed many brands. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emirates Airlines is reportedly worth $5 million</a>.
