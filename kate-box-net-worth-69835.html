The film's producers needed someone who was already an experienced horse rider, leading to Bosworth's successful audition for the role. The film received positive reception from film critics. In 2000, she starred in the television series drama <i>Young Americans</i>, in which she played Bella Banks. The series, however, was canceled. That same year, she had a small part in the film <i>Remember the Titans</i>. In 2001, Bosworth moved to Los Angeles in hopes of obtaining easier access to auditions and better film parts.</p><span>2000</span><p>Bosworth was accepted to Princeton University in late 2000, but because of continual deferral of her attendance, her acceptance was later revoked. She is a member of the Appalachia <a href=#>Service</a> Project.</p><span>2001</span><p>Bosworth developed an interest in competitive horse racing, and by the age of fourteen, she was a champion <a href=#>Equestrian</a>. She graduated from Cohasset High School, in Cohasset, <a href=#>Massachusetts</a>, in 2001.</p><span>2002</span><p>The breakthrough role in Bosworth's career came in the 2002 surfing movie <i>Blue Crush</i>, which she prepared for by working out with two separate trainers seven hours a day for months in order to add fifteen pounds of muscle to her frame. In his review of the film, <i>Rolling Stone</i>'s Peter Travers wrote: "Bosworth is a star in the making, but even she can't outshine the surfing footage, which is flat-out spectacular." The film received positive reviews and grossed $40&nbsp;million at the United States box office. Following the success of <i>Blue Crush</i>, Bosworth took on the lead role in low-budget <i>Wonderland</i> (2003) opposite Val Kilmer.

The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, it has since been picked up by The Weinstein Company.

This film reunites her with co-star Kevin Spacey and <a href=#>Director</a> Robert Luketic. <i>21</i> garnered mixed reviews, with Joanne Kaufman of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> concluding, "Very little adds up in <i>21</i>."</p><span>2008</span><p>In January 2008, Bosworth was named the new face for Calvin Klein Jeans and will be featured in the Calvin Klein Jeans campaign.
