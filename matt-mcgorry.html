Despite his inexperience in the industry, he has made an indelible impression. His brief career has netted him significant fortunes, and he charges exorbitant fees to sign films. Although his net worth is still being calculated, it is expected to be in the millions of dollars.</p><h2>Do you have a girlfriend? Are You Married To Your Wife? Is He Straight, or Gay?</h2><p>Matt’s sexuality and sexual preference have many people wondering how he defines his gender. Matt McGorry considers himself a feminist and believes in marriage equality. He is one of the few people who openly support the gay community and tweets frequently in their favor.</p><p>Similarly, in a tweet posted on July 19, 2013, he stated that he is an honorary gay and enjoys the company of gay people. His tweet and actions imply that he is gay. Matt, on the other hand, has never been seen with anyone, male or female, who could be identified as his partner or spouse. He could be having an affair with one of them. And maybe he just wants a private, secluded love life. So, unless he comes forward with full disclosure of his love life. We can never be too certain of anything.</p><p>In 2014, he marched in the New York City Gay Pride March, and he tweeted:</p>“There was so much love in the air today at #prideNY, it was truly beautiful. Thank you for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! #NoHomo”<p>His tweet, which was later deleted, sparked controversy, and he later claimed that it was all a joke and that his presence in the march would have revealed his true intentions.</p><p>He is a proud feminist, and on March 6, 2005, he posted on Facebook, admitting that he had recently discovered the true meaning of feminism and adding:</p>“Feminism is for both men and women. “I AM A WOMANIST.”<h2>Professional and professional life:</h2><p>During his early career, the American actor attended Emerson College and competed as a bodybuilder. He made his film debut as grey Malcolm in the 2006 film “Thursday.” Following his debut, he appeared in a series of short films before making his big-screen debut with a bang.</p><p>He appeared as Spider-Man in three episodes of the television series “One Life to Live” in 2011. However, his breakthrough role came in 2013 as John Bennett in the critically acclaimed TV series “Orange Is the New Black,” alongside Ian Paola and Pico Alexander, for which he received a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance. He also played Asher Millstone in the hit 2014 series “How to Get Away with Murder.”</p><p>He is now preparing for the film “Step Sisters,” in which he plays the character, Dane.</p><p>Matt’s most recent event was a collaboration with PlayboyPlayboy Magazine to promote a special Pride message. He explained why he partnered with the magazine in a lengthy Instagram message, and how it affects everyone, including the LGBTQ community. He composed; ‘Together, we are supporting The Trevor Project’s efforts to make conversion therapy illegal throughout the United States. You should feel safe AND proud of who you are, regardless of who you love or how you identify. As a cis-hetero man striving to be an ally, it is my honor and duty to stand up for my LGBTQ brothers and sisters whenever possible.</p><h2>Matt’s Brief Bio:</h2><p>He was born on April 12, 1986, as Matthew David McGorry, making him 33 years old. Matt was born in the New York City borough of Manhattan. The Emerson College graduate is of white ethnicity and a citizen of the United States. His wiki is tight-lipped about his family and childhood.</p><p>With a height of 5 feet and 10 inches, he maintains a ribbed body shape, which is not surprising given that he was a former competitive bodybuilder.</p><table border=0 width=100% cellpadding=0 align=left><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h4 class=top>Quick Information</h4></th></tr><tr><td width=65%><table border=0 width=100% cellpadding=0><tbody><tr><th scope=row width=109>Date of Birth</th><td width=159>April 12, 1986</td><th scope=row width=109>Age</th><td width=159>35 Years 2 Month(s)</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109>Nationality</th><td width=159>American</td><th scope=row width=109>Profession</th><td width=159>Actor</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109>Marital Status</th><td width=159>Single</td><th scope=row width=109>Wife/Spouse</th><td width=159>Not Yet</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109>Divorced</th><td width=159>Not Yet</td><th scope=row width=109>Gay/Lesbian</th><td width=159>Yes</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109>Net Worth</th><td width=159>Under Review</td><th scope=row width=109>Ethnicity</th><td width=159>White</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109>Social Media</th><td width=159>Twitter, Instagram, Facebook</td><th scope=row width=109>Children/Kids</th><td width=159>Not Yet</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109>Height</th><td width=159>5 Feet 9 ¾ Inches (177.2 cm)</td><th scope=row width=109>Education</th><td width=159>Emerson College</td></tr><tr><th scope=row width=109>Siblings</th><td width=159>Craig McGorry (Brother)</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p>I hope you enjoyed the article and please leave your questions in the comments section.</p><p>Thank you very much</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaKWRqcFuucKgpquqqWQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmatt-mcgorry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmatt-mcgorry.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmatt-mcgorry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmatt-mcgorry.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmatt-mcgorry.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmatt-mcgorry.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./qualcomm-announces-mesh-networking-wifi-router-reference-design-with-iot-functionality.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./qualcomm-announces-mesh-networking-wifi-router-reference-design-with-iot-functionality.html>Qualcomm Announces Mesh Networking Wi-Fi Router Reference Design with IoT Functionality</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lou-costello-net-worth-2.html>Lou Costello Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lou-costello-net-worth-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
