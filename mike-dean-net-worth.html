Details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Through award-winning work for the likes of <a href=#>Kanye West</a>, <a href=#>Travis Scott</a>, <a href=#>2Pac</a>, <a href=#>Drake</a>, <a href=#>The Weeknd</a>, and many others, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Dean</a> has become somewhat of a legend in the hip-hop community. Thanks to his input, creative direction, and masterful mixing skills, he is largely responsible for some of the most iconic singles, albums, and live performances to emerge from the last three decades of music.</p><p>Aside from the massive kudos he constantly receives from his mega-famous collaborators (as well as the music community overall), Mike has accrued a seriously impressive net worth that is reflective of the hard work and dedication he has put into his craft for so many years. With that being said, how much is he worth exactly? Here's a breakdown of his financial status and what got him to this point in his career.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what is Mike Dean's net worth? Fame isn't the only thing he has gained from his hard work.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Mike is worth an impressive $8 million. It would appear this is largely a result of the work he has done on some of rap's biggest projects, as well as touring both as a solo act and with artists like Kanye and Travis.</p><p>Beyond a specialized interest in hip-hop, R&B, pop, and trap, Mike is a talented multi-instrumentalist who frequently uses live instruments as opposed to samples in his production. He is a passionate player of the guitar, keyboards, bass, bassoon, and cello.</p><p>Born on March 1, 1965, Mike started off his career strong, working as one of the forces behind hit songs from late pop icon <a href=#>Selena</a>. Even with that massive accolade under his belt early on, he remained set on exploring his craft further, becoming instrumental in the creation of a sub-genre of hip-hop called the Dirty South sound in the 1990s. Some of his early rap collaborators are names that defined their time, such as Tha Dogg Pound, 2Pac, Geto Boys, Scarface, and Tech N9ne.</p><p>Although he collaborated with almost all of the biggest names in hip-hop at one point or another, Mike's career in the modern day is mostly synonymous with the successes of Kanye, for whom he has served as an executive producer for almost all of his albums.</p><p>Mike has also toured with Kanye on numerous occasions, often found directly on the side of his longtime collaborator playing either keyboard or guitar to accompany the hit tracks he helped create.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What are some famous songs that Mike Dean has contributed to? His discography is massive.</h2><p>Over the 30-plus years that he has worked alongside some of the biggest musicians on Earth, Mike has compiled one of the most impressive discographies out of any producer in the industry. There are quite literally hundreds if not thousands (if you count unreleased projects) of songs that Mike contributed to, and, as such, listing them all would be enough to fill a book.</p><p>Some of the highlights of his critically acclaimed work among 1990s hip-hop legends include "Now I Feel Ya" by Scarface, "Gangsta" by the Geto Boys, and "Behind the Walls" by Kurupt.</p><p>In the 21st century, Mike is credited with hits such as "Power" by Kanye West, "No Sense" by <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>, "Birthday Song" by <a href=#>2Chainz</a>, and "Partition" by <a href=#>Beyonc√©</a>, among countless others.</p><p>Almost all of the tracks he contributed his skills to have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">broken into top 100</a> charts in the U.S. such as Billboard and also fared well in international markets. To mark the pinnacle of his success, Mike enjoyed his first two number-one hit songs in the U.S. alongside Travis Scott when they released "Highest in the Room" in 2019 and then subsequently "The Scotts" in 2020, which features <a href=#>Kid Cudi</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforassYydnJqmXaOytXnWqKmtoA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmike-dean-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmike-dean-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmike-dean-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmike-dean-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmike-dean-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmike-dean-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./has-anyone-beat-the-cube.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./has-anyone-beat-the-cube.html>Only a Handful of People Have Ever Successfully Beaten 'The Cube'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-do-you-use-the-paintbrush-in-ark-html.html>How do you use the paintbrush in Ark?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-do-you-use-the-paintbrush-in-ark-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
