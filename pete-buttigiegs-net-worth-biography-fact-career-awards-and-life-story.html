His father is from Malta and studied to be a Jesuit priest before emigrating to the U.S. &nbsp;to become a professor of literature at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. His father was a professor at Notre Dame for 29 years. His mother’s family has lived in Indiana for generations. Buttigieg attended St. Joseph High School in South Bend where he was valedictorian of the class of 2000. During his senior year, he won first prize in the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum’s Profiles in Courage essay contest. His essay was about the integrity and political courage of then U.S. Representative Bernie Sanders of Vermont. He was one of only two independent politicians in Congress. Buttigieg traveled to Boston to accept the award and met members of the Kennedy family including Caroline Kennedy.</p><p>Buttigieg attended Harvard University where he majored in history and literature. He was president of the Student Advisory Committee of the Harvard Institute of Politics. He worked on the institute’s annual study of youth attitudes on politics. His undergraduate thesis, titled The Quiet American’s Errand into the Wilderness, was on the influence of puritanism on U.S. foreign policy as reflected in the novel <i>The Quiet American</i> by Graham Greene. Buttigieg graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard in 2004 and was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship.</p><p>Buttigieg worked as an investigative intern at WMAQ, Chicago’s NBC News affiliate while in college.

In November 2015, he was elected to his second term as mayor with over 80% of the vote. In December 2018, Buttigieg announced that he would not seek a third term as mayor of South Bend.</p><p>Buttigieg is a candidate for the Democratic Party’s nomination for the 2020 presidential election.
