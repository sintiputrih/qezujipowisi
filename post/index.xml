Our first compute benchmark comes from Civilization V, which uses DirectCompute to decompress textures on the fly.</description></item><item><title>Gabrielle Union News - Us Weekly</title><link>/gabrielle-union.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/gabrielle-union.html</guid><description>Name:Gabrielle Union
