In the dead of winter, there‚Äôs nothing I crave more than a summer tomato‚Äîsweet, juicy, and ripe. The out-of-season supermarket ones can‚Äôt compare, so when summer rolls around, I only have a few months to make every tomato salad, sandwich, pasta, and pizza I‚Äôve imagined throughout the year. When I made my grocery list this morning, I added cherry tomatoes, heirloom tomatoes, and&nbsp;tomatoes on the vine. We have lots of tomato recipes on tap this week. üôÇ I hope you‚Äôre also cooking with tomatoes like crazy right now, while‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It‚Äôs zucchini season! Bring on the zucchini recipes! Partway through July every summer, I start to feel like I‚Äôve cooked all the zucchini recipes out there. I‚Äôve made zucchini bread and zucchini fritters, grilled zucchini and baked zucchini chips. This week, I looked at my market haul of summer squash and asked, ‚ÄúWhat next?‚Äù. If you‚Äôre in a similar spot right now, I have good news: zucchini is one versatile veggie. It tastes fantastic in pastas, tacos, salads, and even chocolate cake! You can grill it, bake it, saut√© it, and also eat it raw. We might feel like we‚Äôve‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I start daydreaming about asparagus recipes as soon as I notice the first signs of spring. If I see daffodils shooting up in front of a neighbor‚Äôs house, I crave an asparagus frittata. If I glimpse green buds forming on a tree, I want a bowl of asparagus soup. And if the temperature rises above 60¬∞F, I‚Äôm already at the grocery store getting the ingredients for pasta primavera. What can I say? After a long winter filled with root veggies and squash, asparagus recipes are an exciting change. They‚Äôre fresh, bright, and often quick to prepare‚Äîthe beginning of the easy,‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>We have a new favorite recipe in our winter rotation: this vegan ramen! My plant-based riff on the Japanese noodle soup is warming, comforting, and intensely flavorful. It starts with a rich mushroom broth, which I spike with miso paste for extra umami. Then, I add chewy ramen noodles, savory baked tofu, and loads of fresh toppings‚Äìsaut√©ed mushrooms, bok choy, green onions, and daikon radish. A swirl of chili crisp takes it over the top. Ramen is a Japanese preparation of Chinese wheat noodles, and it has been eaten throughout Japan for over a century. You can find tons of‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Pasta e fagioli, sometimes shortened to pasta fagioli (or pasta fazool if you‚Äôre a Sopranos fan), is a classic Italian soup. Its name literally translates to ‚Äúpasta and beans,‚Äù and it consists of tiny pasta, creamy beans, and tender vegetables in a fragrant tomato broth. Here in the US, many people know pasta e fagioli from the menu at Olive Garden, but I‚Äôm here to tell you that you HAVE to try making this dish at home. It comes together in one pot. The ingredients are largely pantry staples. AND the combination of pasta, beans, and veggies makes it a‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Homemade tomato soup is like a hug in a bowl, which, when the weather is as gray as it has been here lately, is exactly what I need. This tomato soup recipe is a cold weather staple in our house. It couldn‚Äôt be simpler to make, and the ingredients are largely pantry basics that I always keep on hand. But more importantly, this tomato soup is creamy, comforting, and full of rich flavor. The tomatoes make it tangy, balsamic vinegar adds sweetness, and red pepper flakes give it a warming kick of heat. You could serve it on its own,‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This kale soup recipe is exactly what I‚Äôm craving these days: comfort food + tons of veggies, all rolled into one. Its creamy broth (which, by the way, is thickened with blended white beans, not heavy cream) is swimming with tender kale and aromatics like onions, carrots, and celery. Rosemary and thyme add piney flavor, and a squeeze of lemon juice gives it the perfect bright finish. If you‚Äôre looking for a dish that is equal parts cozy, healthy, and delicious, look no further. This kale soup is it!

Ask him about the version at Panera Bread, and he‚Äôll go on and on about its creamy texture and rich, tangy, cheesy flavor. He never expected me to develop a broccoli cheddar soup recipe at home (unless you count this vegan twist), but with the holidays right around the corner, I thought it would be fun to surprise him with one. So, on a gray, chilly day last weekend, when we were both craving comfort food, I finally made him this broccoli cheddar soup recipe. As we sat down with our‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I‚Äôve had a stash of this acorn squash soup in my freezer for the last couple of weeks, ready and waiting for the type of cold fall day that necessitates creamy orange soup. Well, last weekend, that day finally came. Saturday arrived, chilly and crisp, and I knew that this acorn squash soup would hit the spot. I heated up a bowl for lunch, and I enjoyed it so much that I polished off the rest on Sunday. This weekend, I‚Äôm definitely making more. This acorn squash soup is sublimely creamy (but not from cream!), and it‚Äôs deliciously seasoned with‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This Instant Pot chili delivers everything you love about regular chili‚Äìa smoky tomato broth, tender peppers, and hearty beans‚Äìbut it has the added bonus of being a set-it-and-forget-it recipe. I won‚Äôt argue that regular chili is difficult to make (I call my recipe Easy Vegetarian Chili, after all), but it does require you to stay nearby the kitchen if not in it, close enough to adjust the heat of your stove from time to time to maintain a lively simmer. For most of my life, I loved that aspect of making chili or soup. I wanted to hang out in‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Tortilla soup is one of my favorite foods. Not just one of my favorite soups (though of course it is), but one of my favorite foods in general. I love how the rich, flavorful broth contrasts with toppings like crunchy tortilla strips and creamy avocado. Now that the temperatures are cooling off for the season, you can bet that I‚Äôll have this tortilla soup recipe on repeat. Tortilla soup (or sopa de tortilla or sopa Azteca) is thought to have originated in central Mexico, though you can find regional variations throughout Mexico and the US today.
