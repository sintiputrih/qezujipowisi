You’ve done what you need to do,'” Lt. Col. Andrew Watson recalled at a dedication ceremony for Rescorla in 2015, “but he pointed up the stairwell and said, ‘You hear those screams? There’s more people up there. I have to help get them out.'”</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-478062 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rick-rescorla.png alt="Rick Rescorla" width=800 height=708 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-478062 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Congressional Medal of Honor Society</span><span class=caption-body>Rick Rescorla spent years preparing for a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center — and on 9/11, his planning saved thousands.</span></p><p>Rescorla’s actions cost him his life — but they secured his legacy as a hero.</p><h2>Rick Rescorla’s Heroism On 9/11</h2><p>When American Airlines Flight 11 <a href=# rel=noopener>crashed into the North Tower</a> of the World Trade Center on 9/11, Rick Rescorla was working on the 44th floor of the South Tower. The war hero stayed calm and ignored the orders blasting from the loudspeaker to shelter in place. Instead, Rescorla grabbed a megaphone and began evacuating 2,700 Morgan Stanley employees.</p><p>The workers knew what to do — Rescorla had led them in an emergency evacuation training program he’d created twice a year.</p><p>Rescorla’s wife, Susan, called him when she saw the news that a plane had hit the North Tower. He was busy leading evacuation efforts, but one of his co-workers told her, “Don’t worry. It’s fine, it’s contained. Rick is getting everyone out. He’s out there with the bullhorn now.”</p><p>Rick Rescorla’s plan went smoothly at first, but when a second plane struck the South Tower, the urgency to escape grew. So, Rescorla began to sing his own version of “Men of Harlech,” a Welsh battle song, over the megaphone. Years earlier in Vietnam, Rescorla had sung to his men, calming their nerves on the killing fields of Ia Drang.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-478055 alt="South Tower Impact" width=800 height=978 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/south-tower-impact.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-478055 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>National Institute of Standards and Technology</span><span class=caption-body>When United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower, Rick Rescorla had already begun to evacuate 2,700 Morgan Stanley employees.</span></p><p>As he led the evacuation, Rescorla called Susan for the last time. “Stop crying,” he told her. “I have to get these people out safely. If something should happen to me, I want you to know I’ve never been happier. You made my life.”</p><p>Even when the Morgan Stanley employees reached safety, Rescorla refused to leave anyone behind. He headed back up the stairs to save more lives.</p><p>Rescorla was last seen on the 10th floor of the South Tower moments before it collapsed. His body was never recovered.</p><p>“He had a choice,” said Susan at the 2015 dedication ceremony, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Military.com</a>. “He could have walked out of there anytime he wanted to. If he was here today, he would be proud.”</p><p>However, Rick Rescorla’s heroic action on 9/11 wasn’t the first time he’d made a tough choice to save others.</p><h2>Who Was Rick Rescorla?</h2><p>Born in Cornwall in 1939, Rick Rescorla watched American soldiers stationed in his hometown as a boy. Fascinated by the World War II infantrymen, Rescorla would later follow in their footsteps, joining the British military at 16 years old.</p><p>So, how did a Cornish soldier end up working in security at the Twin Towers? Decades earlier, Rescorla had moved to the U.S. to fight in Vietnam.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-478065 alt="Rick Rescorla In Vietnam" width=800 height=642 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rick-rescorla-vietnam.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-478065 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>United States Army</span><span class=caption-body>Rick Rescorla was a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War.</span></p><p>After serving in the British military as a paratrooper and a police inspector, Rescorla wanted more action. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Sky HISTORY</a>, his friend Daniel Hill recalled, “He was looking for bang-bang shoot-’em-up.” Hill suggested they both enlist in the U.S. Army so they could see action in the Vietnam War.</p><p>In 1963, Rescorla finished basic training at Fort Dix in New Jersey. He was quickly promoted as an officer. And two years later, the Cornishman was a platoon leader in the midst of one of the deadliest battles in a bloody war.</p><h2>How A Cornishman Became A Vietnam War Hero</h2><p>In Vietnam, Rescorla’s platoon landed via helicopter in Ia Drang Valley, which became known as the Valley of Death. The brutal battle was the first major engagement between U.S. forces and the People’s Army of North Vietnam.</p><p>While holding their line for three long days, Rescorla kept up his men’s spirits through song.</p><p>“We were all sitting in our holes with our knees knocking, we have dead guys all around us, and here comes Rick singing Cornish songs,” recalled radio operator Sam Fantino.</p><p>Rescorla earned the nickname “Hard Core” in Vietnam, along with a Purple Heart and a Silver Star. When the war ended, the veteran returned to America and became a U.S. citizen. He earned a law degree and got married. By the mid-1980s, Rescorla was working in corporate security at the World Trade Center.</p><p>Before the 1993 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, Rescorla and Hill, who had become a counterterrorism expert, thoroughly inspected the Twin Towers for security weaknesses. Rescorla warned that the basement parking garage left the towers vulnerable to attack — but authorities ignored him. Then, in 1993, a truck bomb exploded in the parking garage, killing six.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-478061 alt="1993 Bombing Wreckage" width=900 height=625 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1993-bombing-wreckage.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-478061 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Federal Bureau of Investigation</span><span class=caption-body>Even before the 1993 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, Rick Rescorla warned authorities that the basement presented a security risk.</span></p><p>On that day in 1993, according to the <a href=# rel=noopener>9/11 Memorial & Museum</a>, Rescorla led the Morgan Stanley evacuation. Convinced that terrorists would target the Twin Towers in the future, Rescorla designed a strict disaster contingency plan, which he regularly rehearsed with employees.</p><p>That plan allowed Rescorla to save 2,700 lives on 9/11.</p><h2>Earning The Presidential Citizens Medal</h2><p>Rick Rescorla was not supposed to be in the Twin Towers on 9/11. He gave up a holiday to let a colleague take the day off. But when the planes hit the towers, Rescorla leaped into action.</p><p>During the chaos, Rescorla called his Vietnam War buddy Dan Hill. On their last phone call, Rescorla told Hill to get to New York as soon as possible — he’d be needed for rescue efforts.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-478056 alt="South Tower In Flames" width=591 height=1023 data-sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/south-tower-smoke.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-478056 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>National Institute of Standards and Technology</span><span class=caption-body>In spite of the danger, Rick Rescorla returned to the South Tower after evacuating 2,700 Morgan Stanley employees.</span></p><p>In 2019, Rick Rescorla received the Presidential Citizens Medal posthumously. During the ceremony, battalion commander Watson praised Rescorla for his service.</p><p>“How better can you epitomize selfless service to a nation than to first embark on the conflict in Vietnam, and then to continue to serve your community at every level you find yourself?” Watson asked.</p><p>Watson praised Rescorla for giving his “last full measure of dedication of service and support in an unexpected terrorist attack.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-478052 alt="Rick Rescorla's Memorial" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rescorla-memorial.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-478052 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Luigi Novi/Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Rick Rescorla’s name appears at the National September 11 Memorial.</span></p><p>Rick Rescorla was one of just 13 Morgan Stanley employees who died on 9/11. Without Rescorla’s fearless heroism, which saved 2,700 lives, that number would have been much higher.</p><p>As Hill put it, “You see, for Rick Rescorla, this was a natural death… There are certain men born in this world, and they’re supposed to die setting an example for the rest of the weak bastards we’re surrounded with.”</p><p>Rick Rescorla was one of many heroes who saved lives on 9/11.
