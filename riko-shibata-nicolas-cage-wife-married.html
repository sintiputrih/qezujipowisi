We're really happy together and we're really excited to spend that time together so I finally just said, 'Look. I wanna marry you and we got engaged on FaceTime."</strong></span></p><p><span>The couple was first spotted together when they visited his famous tomb in February 2020, which he bought for himself decades earlier.&nbsp;</span><span>Riko married Nicolas Cage in a poetic Japanese wedding ceremony.</span></p><p><span>Riko dressed in a handmade Japanese Bridal Kimono from Kyoto during their wedding ceremony, and Nicolas was in a Tom Ford tuxedo. They exchanged their traditional Catholic and Shinto vows with poetry, as per the reports from People. Famous poets like Walt Whitman and Haiku poems were included in their wedding, and after the ceremony, they headed to a small gathering at the home of Nicolas' ex-wife, Alice Kim.</span></p><p><span>According to Cage's representative, their wedding date was chosen to celebrate the bridegroom's late father's birthday. They applied for their wedding license on January 10â€” the day she turned 26.</span></p><p><span>Riko also walked down the aisle to her favorite song called Winter Song by Kiroro.</span></p><p><span>Before Riko, her famous actor husband, Nicolas, married four times.
