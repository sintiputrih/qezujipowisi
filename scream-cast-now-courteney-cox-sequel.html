She then went on to wed fellow actor John Light in 2007, but by 2010 they had split.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Film</h2></p><p>Neve has now found love with actor JJ Feild and in August 2012 they welcome their son Caspian.</p><p>Six years later they announced the adoption of their second son Raynor.</p><p>In 2021 she revealed that she had been attacked by a bear aged 17 on a film set.</p><p>Speaking on The Kelly Clarkson show, she said: "I dipped my hand in honey and I run to this rock, and I turn around and I put my hand out and the bear is not slowing down and he's not coming for my hand, he grabs me by the leg and he pulls me through the forest.</p><p>"My mother was visiting set and she's screaming. The whole crew is frozen because nobody can believe what's happening. All I can think to say is, 'He's biting me,' like it's not obvious."</p><p>Thankfully, no one was seriously hurt.</p><h2>Skeet Ulrich (Billy Loomis)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hp-scream-skeet.jpg><p>Skeet, 53, has recently gained a new generation of fans for his role as Forsythe Pendleton "F.P." Jones II on Netflix's Riverdale.</p><p>Like his co-star Neve, he has not always been lucky in love. His first marriage lasted eight years, his second just four and his third engagement lasted less than a year.</p><p>In 2021, he started a romance with Pretty Little Liars actress Lucy Hale who is 20 years his junior.</p><p>Things didn't work out and the pair decided they were better suited as just friends.</p><p>In 2017, Skeet claimed that "most people" in the industry knew about Harvey Weinstein's behaviour towards women.</p><h2>Courteney Cox (Gale Weathers)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hp-scream-court.jpg><p><a href=#>Courteney</a>, 58, is best known for her role as Monica in Friends, but before that, she appeared in Scream.</p><p>Her career has been hugely successful, but unfortunately, her private life has been far from easy.</p><p>Starring in the horror flick introduced her to David Arquette - who she married in 1999.</p><p>The pair welcomed their daughter Coco in 2004, but announced their divorce in 2013.</p><p>Three years after the birth of her only child, Courtney opened up about suffering from postpartum depression.</p><p>She told USA Today: "I went through a really hard time - not right after the baby, but when (Coco) turned six months.</p><p>"I couldn't sleep. My heart was racing. And I got really depressed. I went to the doctor and found out my hormones had been pummelled."</p><p>Since late 2013 she has been in a relationship with Snow Patrol's Johnny McDaid.</p><p>The actress also admitted she had gone too far with <a href=#>her plastic surgery</a> and ended up looking "strange" and like a different person as a result.</p><p>In 2017, she said: "I've had all my fillers dissolved. I'm as natural as I can be. I feel better because I look like myself. I think that I now look more like the person I was. I hope I do."</p><h2>Drew Barrymore (Casey Becker)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hp-scream-drew.jpg><p>Drew, 48, is one of the most famous people in the world thanks to her acting credits in blockbusters like E.T and Charlie's Angels.</p><p>The former child star struggled with alcohol and drug addiction during her teenage years.</p><p>Mum Jaid took her to New York’s infamous Studio 54 club, where Drew encountered drugs and danced with young stars.

My life is about writing a script that means something emotional to me," he told <a href=#>Buzzfeed</a>.</p><p>"My life is about teaching and trying to grow as an artist. My life is about trying to cultivate my craft. There's no quitting because you could get a job at any time even if you haven't worked in 10 years."</p><h2>Rose McGowan (Tatum Riley)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hp-scream-rose.jpg><p><a href=#>Rose</a>, 49, shot to fame in Scream as Tatum Riley and went on to appear in a host of movies and TV shows including fantasy classic Charmed.</p><p>In 2017 she alleged that she had been raped by Harvey Weinstein and that Amazon Studios had dropped a project she was in after she reported it.</p><p>The same year, it was reported that Rose had received a $100,000 settlement from the disgraced mogul for an alleged sexual assault in 1997.</p><p>She was one of the most prominent women to speak out about his sexual assaults, which sparked the MeToo movement.</p><p>Two years later, she accused film director Alexander Payne of statutory rape, alleging that he had intercourse with her when she was just 15 years old.
