There was no time to lose. As soon as they finished, the weather changed and snow began to fall. The Wild Hunt appeared above Kaer Morhen and its spectral warriors galloped out of the sky towards the fortress.</p><h3 class=he-c>2. Exit the keep and join Lambert when you're ready to face the Wild Hunt.</h3><p>When you go outside, the weather will change after a while, announcing the arrival of the Wild Hunt.

You can use dimeritium bombs or the Yrden sign to close them.

If Zoltan is available, he will kill the Wild Hunt warrior who walks towards you. The you should run across the battlements to Triss and kill all enemies that are around. You can use your new skills: <strong>Magic Amulet</strong> (It calls down a fireball to pulverize a given area. Once you use it, you should move aside, or a magic projectile will hit you!), and <strong>Charge</strong> (Very strong and fast attack that can knocks down foes).</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/run-to-trisss-aid-on-the-battlements.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Run to Triss's aid on the battlements. / Defeat the warriors threatening Triss." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>5.

After a while, when Caranthir starts using magic tricks, and thus tip the scales of victory in his favor, Ciri will join the fight and save Eskel. However, she won't defeat Caranthir because after a while, at the sound of the Wild Hunt horn, Caranthir will use the teleport and retreat, and only his warriors will remain on the battlefield.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/help-triss-fight-the-hunts-warriors-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Get to Triss. / Help Triss fight the Hunt's warriors." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>10.

The generals of the Hunt had entered the fray personally. Vesemir had died by Imlerith's hand, and it seemed all of the witcher's friends would soon share his fate. The defenders' lives were hanging by a thread, when suddenly Ciri's magic talent revealed its full force. In an uncontrolled outburst of rage she pummeled both allies and enemies alike with a blast of pure Power. The Hunt's forces were nearly wiped out, leaving them no choice but to retreat. Only our valiant defenders, exhausted, wounded, but still alive, remained on the field of battle.</p><p>When the evening comes, Vesemir's funeral will take place, during which Ciri will say she's tired of running away and Avallac'h will ask you to talk, and then the quest will be over.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/help-triss-fight-the-wild-hunt-by-the-gate-to-the-inner-courtyard-5.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Help Triss fight the Wild Hunt by the gate to the inner courtyard." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>If only Vesemir died in the battle:</p><p>The Battle of Kaer Morhen was over.
