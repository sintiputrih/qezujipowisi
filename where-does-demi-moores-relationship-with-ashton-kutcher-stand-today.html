Rumer was 12 or 13 when we first started dating. When we were getting divorced, Tallulah was graduating high school,” he gushed. “I was helping raise teenage girls through their adolescence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I love them. I’m never going to stop loving them and respecting them and honoring them and rooting for them to be successful in whatever they are pursuing. I was never trying to be their father.

Then I saw my son, daughter, and wife and I deleted it.”</p><p>The comment appeared to insinuate that the 42-year-old would have shared his side of the story — which apparently wouldn’t have been a pleasant one — but considering that he has a family to think about before anything else, he decided not to share the snarky tweet after all.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Much Mila Kunis Makes Voicing Meg Griffin On ‘Family Guy’</a></span></p><p>Whatever it is that Kutcher would’ve wanted to tell the world, it wouldn’t have changed the fact that Moore lost their baby and that he appeared to have cheated on her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking about the heartbreaking miscarriage in her book, the Charlie’s Angels star explained: “I can’t even bring into words how lost, empty, desperate, confused [I was]. I really lost sight of everything that was right in front of me, which was the family I had.</p><p>“And I think that the weight that it put on Ashton, it’s kind of a natural thing to pull back, when somebody’s clinging too tight.”</p><p>And while both parties have moved on with their lives, Moore and Kutcher continue to collaborate on their human rights company Thorn: Digital Defenders of Children, which is helping address the sexual exploitation of minors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While she’s been on dates here and there, Moore, for the most part, has chosen to remain single for the foreseeable future, and by the look of things, that decision has certainly worked in her favor as she’s not only managed to end her drug addiction but, as revealed in her book, she’s also learned to find peace with herself.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Are Divided Over Ashton Kutcher’s Post About Science Vs Fiction</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZ2imnqlu8SsZJ2dnZ56rrvOq5ysZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq4tdOhZJqrmKm8r3nKrqucoJWnerTAwKebZqyfma66ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-does-demi-moores-relationship-with-ashton-kutcher-stand-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhere-does-demi-moores-relationship-with-ashton-kutcher-stand-today.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhere-does-demi-moores-relationship-with-ashton-kutcher-stand-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhere-does-demi-moores-relationship-with-ashton-kutcher-stand-today.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-does-demi-moores-relationship-with-ashton-kutcher-stand-today.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-does-demi-moores-relationship-with-ashton-kutcher-stand-today.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gio2saucy-net-worth-207459.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gio2saucy-net-worth-207459.html>Gio2saucy Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./selena-gomez-de-una-vez-song-video.html>Watch Her Spanish-Language Song Video Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./selena-gomez-de-una-vez-song-video.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
