At one time, Lohan was one of the most talked-about celebrities in the world as she was a successful pop star and she starred in many popular movies. Unfortunately, however, Lohan’s career hit the skids and she seemingly frittered away a lot of money. For that reason, she was worth only $800,000 at one point but according to celebritynetworth.com, Lohan’s current fortune amounts to $1.5 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Lindsay Lohan Ended Up With Her (Current) $800,000 Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=tara-reid-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-2-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Tara Reid’s Net Worth Is $2 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Years before she was linked to Travis Barker in 2009, Tara Reid seemingly was on top of the world since starring in American Pie made her internationally famous.

Amazingly enough, many observers found Arianny Celeste so eye-grabbing when she performed in that role that she was launched to fame. While it has never been confirmed that they were involved, it is rumored that Celeste had a fling with Travis Barker in 2014 after her rise to fame.
