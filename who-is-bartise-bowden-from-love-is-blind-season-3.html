<time>17 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Bartise Bowden is one of 30 hopefuls slated to participate in Netflix’s Love is Blind Season 3, which premieres on Wednesday, October 19, 2022. He works as a Senior Analyst for a healthcare organization and is seeking a fun relationship. Before suffering several ankle problems, the celebrity was also a basketball player. Viewers will have to tune in this week to watch his adventure on the reality dating show and see his pod experience.</p><p>Love is Blind has been a huge hit with viewers. Loyal showgoers have been watching the candidates’ progress on a regular basis. Season 3 will expose fans to an entirely new ensemble of characters who will bring their life experiences to the pod in order to locate a prospective mate by the conclusion of the season. Will they ever find love? Time will only tell.</p><h2>Bartise Bowden, the star of Love Is Blind, was an athlete.</h2><p>Season 3 of Love is Blind will feature the 27-year-old Dallas, Texas native as he starts on a mission to discover a suitable mate with whom he can spend the rest of his life. According to his Netflix profile, laughing is at the top of Bartise’s priorities list. “He’s searching for someone who can “handle all of his jokes” and “crack some back” at him,” he says.</p><p>Stephen and Ayesha Curry are the ideal pair in Bartise’s opinion. The biography continues:</p><p>“Bartise says he is still unmarried because of “pickiness,” and he wishes to demonstrate that there is more “worth” to gym-loving individuals like himself than his training lifestyle.”</p><p>In high school, Bartise was an athlete and a basketball player. However, injuries prevented him from playing, and he began weight training roughly seven years ago. In an interview with BodyBuilders.com, he discussed his ailments, saying:</p><p>“I was a high school athlete, and after breaking my ankle in a basketball game my senior year, I realized my hopes of playing D-1 basketball were dead. I went to a D-3 school to play basketball, but I ended up breaking my second ankle and had another surgery, so I quit the sport.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bartise-Bowden-1.jpg alt="Bartise Bowden" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He said that his love of weightlifting has helped him balance his physical and emotional wellness. He began weight training when he was 20 years old. In a 2019 interview, Bartise stated:</p><p>“I began weight training when I was 20 years old, roughly 4 years ago. I became engrossed in the procedure. I am physically, psychologically, and emotionally hooked on progress. It fascinates me how we can radically alter our bodies by regulating and managing what we eat and how we exercise.”</p><p>Bartise graduated from The University of Texas at Dallas with a Bachelor of Arts in 2017 and a Master of Science in Accounting in 2018. From 2017 to 2018, he worked as an Audit Intern and Accounting Tutor before becoming an Audit Associate in 2020 and a Senior Associate in 2021 before joining a healthcare firm as a Senior Analyst.</p><p>In a sneak look from Love is Blind Season 3, Bartise writes on his Instagram stories:</p><p>“This will not be there in sixty years when I am 85 years old [poiting towards himself]. I want someone to appreciate me for who I am on the inside rather than what I represent on the exterior.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bartise-Bowden-2.jpg alt="Bartise Bowden" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Season 3 of Love is Blind is almost approaching.
