Stay on the phone for as long as you possibly can, maybe even ask her if you can record the conversation. When you talk- Thank her over and over again for being your mom. Tell her you know she did her best, and her best was more than enough- in fact, it was perfect. Thank her for helping you become the person you are today. Tell her that you hope you’re making her proud,” Brynn wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Because one day… you will feel how I do today. The day you have to endure your first Mother’s Day without her. Your first Mother’s Day where you can’t call her, you can’t send her a card, you can’t buy her flowers,” she continued. “And let me to tell you: your heart is going to ache in ways, and in places, and in depths, that you never knew it could.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Her Bravo bio states that Darelene taught Brynn “invaluable lessons about navigating life, owning her narrative as a bi-racial woman, and the true meaning of hard work.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Brynn has not spoken much about her biracial background, but she does share a reminder of it every so often when she posts a pic or video of her gorgeous natural hair <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on the ‘gram</a>, as seen below.</p><h2>Brynn Is A College Graduate</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Brynn graduated from Indiana’s Purdue University with a bachelor’s degree in communications, public relations, and advertising and a minor in political science, according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a> page.
