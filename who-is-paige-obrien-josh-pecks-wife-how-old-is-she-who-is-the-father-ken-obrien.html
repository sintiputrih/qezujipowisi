How Old is She?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Josh Peck’s beautiful wife was born Paige O’Brien on the 7th&nbsp;day of December 1990 in the United States of America. There are so many things that are quite unknown about this amazing wife of Josh. Although details about her childhood are unknown as well as her academic records. That fact does not necessarily connote that Paige did not get an education, as her skills and the level of professionalism displayed in her career as a cinematographer and film editor is excellent.</p><p>Some of O’Brien’s body of works include her debut production in 2001, a documentary&nbsp;The Journey. The mastery she showed in these projects earned her another job titled Let Go (2013), it was then followed by her third being Black Wolf (2013) all as a cinematographer. As a film editor, Paige is the brain behind the short documentary titled Tell Me a Story (2014).</p><p>Paige stands few inches shorter than her husband Joshua Michael Peck who stands at 6 feet (1.83 m). S</p><p>he has earned quite a handsome amount for her works running into 6 digits which is not bad as she has the years ahead to earn more.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-the-father-%e2%80%93-ken-obrien></span><strong>Who is the Father – Ken O’Brien?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paige O’Brien was born to Shelly O’Brien and Ken O’Brien. She has three other siblings bringing the number of children born by her parents to four. They are two sisters; Blake O’Brien and Taylor O’Brien and a brother Kelly O’Brien.</p><p>Paige’s father has had his fair share of popularity during his prime and is still very famous.&nbsp; Ken O’Brien was a footballer in the American National Football League (NFL) where he played for the New York Jets and later for the Philadelphia Eagles. Though he has retired as a footballer, he is not yet tired with the game seeing that Ken now works as a coach.

The news of their engagement was made available to their fans in the month of March 2016 through Paige’s Instagram page following the display of her sparkling diamond engagement ring. In one of the pictures she uploaded then, the smiling love birds were standing outside the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France.</p><p>One year after their engagement, they walked down the aisle in June 2017, in Malibu, California where they took their marital vows in a private ceremony attended by close friends and family members.</p><p>One very person who was conspicuously absent in the wedding as a result of not being invited was Josh’s former co-star, Drake Bell. He did not hide his disappointment as he took to Twitter to express his anger by saying that true color was shown that day with a clear message. He still congratulated Josh but advised him to remember where he came from. We hope the duo must have settled whatever that may have caused the rift if indeed there was any.</p><p>Paige O’Brien took to her Instagram handle on August 23, 2018, to herald their first pregnancy and the fact that they were expecting their first child as a couple. The Cinematographer and her actor husband welcomed their parcel of Joy (a son) in December of 2018. The cute son was named Max Milo Dobrik Peck.</p><p>The Beautiful blonde sure has an active Instagram page where she posts what is happening in her life letting her fans into her world. Her Instagram page has accumulated about 333k followings so far and still counting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ypmKKflWK8o77InqVmop%2BotW68xJyirGWnnrOmeceormannJl6qr%2BMrJ%2BeZaedvG610maroZ1dm661tMSrZKSdnmK8o77InqVo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-paige-obrien-josh-pecks-wife-how-old-is-she-who-is-the-father-ken-obrien.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-paige-obrien-josh-pecks-wife-how-old-is-she-who-is-the-father-ken-obrien.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-paige-obrien-josh-pecks-wife-how-old-is-she-who-is-the-father-ken-obrien.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-paige-obrien-josh-pecks-wife-how-old-is-she-who-is-the-father-ken-obrien.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-paige-obrien-josh-pecks-wife-how-old-is-she-who-is-the-father-ken-obrien.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-paige-obrien-josh-pecks-wife-how-old-is-she-who-is-the-father-ken-obrien.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./creamy-cajun-chicken-pasta.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./creamy-cajun-chicken-pasta.html>Creamy Cajun Chicken Pasta Modern Honey</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rihanna-asap-rocky-son-everything-you-need-to-know.html>Who are Rihanna's boyfriend and son?
