We'll look back on a bad decision he made back in 2014 against a neighbor. Not only did it cost Bieber some money, but he was also forced into anger management classes and community service.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=celebs-not-getting-along-with-their-neighbors-isn-t-anything-new>Celebs Not Getting Along With Their Neighbors Isn't Anything New</h2><p>Although it isn't commonly discussed, taking issue with a celebrity neighbor does happen more times than fans would think. In the past, there has been a plethora of situations, <a href=#>including some of top stars in both music and film.</a></p><p>Madonna is a name that instantly comes to mind, from her massive entourage to using an apartment as a studio, the legendary pop star was not the most popular figure amongst her neighbors.</p><p>Living next to James Franco turned out to be just as difficult, the actor, similar to Madonna, used his home as a professional playground and at times, like a Hollywood set. This was especially problematic given that he moved onto a quiet street which was not accustomed to such action.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Real Reason Ferrari Banned Justin Bieber From Buying Their Cars</a></span></p><p>On a lighter note, the always honest Dakota Johnson shared the hilarious story alongside Jimmy Kimmel of a neighbor calling a tow truck to get rid of an old school Ford F-150 truck that was gifted by her late grandfather.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is said that the neighbors got tired to looking outside and starring down the truck, so ultimately, they tried to get it removed.

Keep in mind it all went down when Justin was 20-years-old back in 2014. Biebs made plenty of questionable decisions back then and this one, turned out to be very costly.</p><p>According to the LA Times, not only did Bieber fork over $80,000, but he was also forced into taking anger management classes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Justin Bieber has paid more than $80,000 in restitution to resolve a criminal misdemeanor vandalism charge filed after his neighbor’s home in Calabasas was egged, authorities said."</p><p>"Bieber, who pleaded no contest to the vandalism charge in July, has also completed a good chunk of his anger management classes, his attorney told a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Real Reason Justin Bieber Called His Dad Jeremy "Immature" During His Childhood</a></span></p><p>As if that wasn't tough enough, Bieber also had to complete a few hours of community service.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was far from the only incident, it was said that Justin's neighbors were not pleased with his behavior, especially when it came to speeding, this was a problem with the pop star and his friends.</p><p>Ultimately, Justin sold the property to Khloe Kardashian, and we assume the block had quite the party because of it...</p><p>Justin caused $20,000 in damages thanks to the egging situation, but fans are wondering exactly who was the person on the other end of the egging?</p><h2 id=justin-bieber-egged-web-mogul-jeff-schwartz-rsquo-s-mansion>Justin Bieber Egged Web Mogul Jeff Schwartz’s Mansion</h2><p>Jeff Schwartz is quite the name online, especially when it comes to the automotive culture. According to Hosbeg, Jeff worked with brands like, US Autoparts, Autoweb, TraderNet, Autobytel and several other companies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Jeff, the major difficulty is the trauma the situation caused his daughter and wife. <a href=#>The web mogul was especially displeased with the behavior of Justin's bodyguards.</a></p><p>"The bodyguard said the following to him: “What are you going to do about it, Jew boy?” in response to what Schwartz said to Bieber. Schwartz claims that this, coupled with other insults from Bieber, has caused him and his wife great emotional distress and that is why he is suing Bieber."</p><p>It was a moment of learning for Justin as following the incident, the reports of his bad behavior from home dwindled away. These days, he is very much a different person, but he'll always have this tough moment to look back on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>8 Times Justin Bieber Showed He Has Serious Anger Issues</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaejmnqpu9SsnGacmZl6q8HSraCnZZKesqOx0WacoJ9f</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhose-house-did-justin-bieber-egg.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhose-house-did-justin-bieber-egg.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhose-house-did-justin-bieber-egg.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhose-house-did-justin-bieber-egg.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhose-house-did-justin-bieber-egg.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhose-house-did-justin-bieber-egg.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./choosing-a-gaming-cpu-single-multigpu-at-1440p.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./choosing-a-gaming-cpu-single-multigpu-at-1440p.html>CPUs, GPUs, Motherboards, and Memory</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./aja-metoyer-dwyane-wade.html>Who Is Aja Metoyer, Dwyane Wades Baby Mama?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./aja-metoyer-dwyane-wade.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
