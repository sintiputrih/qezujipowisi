The Warriors had an 18-point lead going into the final quarter but ended up losing in a last-second defeat. Here's a closer look at the reasons behind Kerr's decision and the implications it has for the team.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Kuminga's Performance and Bench Time</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Kuminga had an impressive performance, scoring 16 points, grabbing 4 rebounds, and dishing out 4 assists in just 19 minutes of play. However, from the 5:48 mark of the third quarter onwards, he rode the bench. Kerr explained that Andrew Wiggins was playing well and the team was rolling, which affected Kuminga's normal rotation. The decision to keep Kuminga on the bench was influenced by Wiggins' strong performance and the team's comfortable lead.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Wiggins' Impact and Decision Making</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Kerr highlighted Wiggins' strong play as a factor in his decision to stick with the group on the court, including Wiggins, instead of inserting Kuminga back into the game. Wiggins had been playing well but struggled later in the fourth quarter. His substitution by Dario Saric after losing a pivotal defensive rebound chance contributed to the Nuggets' comeback.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Kerr's Coaching Style and Criticism</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Steve Kerr has faced criticism in the past for not playing young players enough. The decision to bench Kuminga in a crucial moment has only heightened the scrutiny on Kerr's coaching decisions. Critics argue that Kerr should have given Kuminga more playing time, especially when the team needed a spark in the fourth quarter. This situation adds to the pressure on Kerr to provide opportunities for the younger players on the team.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Trend of Unusual Benching Decisions</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Kerr's decision to bench Kuminga is not an isolated incident. There have been previous instances where Kerr made questionable decisions regarding playing time for young players. This trend of unusual benching decisions has sparked concern among fans and analysts, who question the impact it may have on the development of these players. The odd benching of Kuminga follows the delayed introduction of rookie Trayce Jackson-Davis to meaningful minutes and the decision to sub out productive player Moses Moody during a fourth-quarter collapse.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Importance of Rest and Experience</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Kerr's decision to prioritize playing experienced players over young talents can be attributed to the desire to win games in the present moment. Kerr acknowledged that Kuminga had been sitting for a while and it didn't feel like the right thing to do to put him back in the game. Kerr's focus on winning and relying on experienced players reflects a veteran-oriented approach that may not always align with the desire to give young players valuable playing time.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Steve Kerr's decision to bench Jonathan Kuminga in the fourth quarter against the Denver Nuggets has raised questions and criticism. While Kuminga had a strong performance, Kerr opted to stick with the group that was on the court, including Andrew Wiggins, who was playing well at the time. This decision is part of a trend of unusual benching decisions by Kerr, which has led to concerns about the development of young players on the team. Kerr's focus on winning and the experience of veteran players may sometimes overshadow the need to provide opportunities for the team's younger talents.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn7JllJ6xbr%2FTnq2eZZuav7N5wZ6lnKBdn7yvrdOhmKdlm6q6qrrGmmSipl2ptaZ5k62fZqmllr%2B1sdFmraxlpJ2ybrDEp62eql2jwqizxK2q</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-steve-kerr-bench-jonathan-kuminga-in-the-4th-quarter-vs-the-denver-nuggets.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-did-steve-kerr-bench-jonathan-kuminga-in-the-4th-quarter-vs-the-denver-nuggets.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-steve-kerr-bench-jonathan-kuminga-in-the-4th-quarter-vs-the-denver-nuggets.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-did-steve-kerr-bench-jonathan-kuminga-in-the-4th-quarter-vs-the-denver-nuggets.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-steve-kerr-bench-jonathan-kuminga-in-the-4th-quarter-vs-the-denver-nuggets.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-steve-kerr-bench-jonathan-kuminga-in-the-4th-quarter-vs-the-denver-nuggets.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-do-they-call-david-ortiz-big-papi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-do-they-call-david-ortiz-big-papi.html>Why do they call David Ortiz Big Papi?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-did-pedro-grajalez-do-suspect-arrested-after-stabbing-girlfriend-to-death-620385-html.html>What did Pedro Grajalez do?
