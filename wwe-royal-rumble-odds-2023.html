<time>07 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>The Road to WrestleMania 39 officially gets started when the Royal Rumble rolls into San Antonio on January 28th.</strong></p><p>The annual event is one of the most anticipated on the WWE calendar, often surprising fans with unexpected returns and plenty of creative twists and turns.&nbsp;</p><p>The winner of the men’s and women’s Royal Rumbles will get a headline spot and a shot at Championship gold at WrestleMania, but who will be able to outlast 29 other superstars to secure their date with destiny? Let’s take a look at how the bookies think the Rumbles will play out, and see who is likely to be left standing at the end of the night.&nbsp;</p><h2>Men’s Royal Rumble 2023 Odds</h2><p>The following odds are available for the winner of the 2023 Men’s Royal Rumble match.&nbsp;</p><h2>Women’s Royal Rumble 2023 Odds</h2><p>The following odds are currently available for the winner of the 2023 Women’s Royal Rumble match.&nbsp;</p><h2>Royal Rumble betting offers</h2><h3>Unibet</h3><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">UNIBET</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/12/Talksport-Unibet-Review-1.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Get money back offers with Unibet</p><p>When new players join Unibet they can get take advantage of a £40 money sports back bonus, as well as £10 in casino funds.

New players will need to place a £10 bet at odds of 1/2 or higher in order to qualify. They will then receive their bonus as three separate £10 bets.&nbsp;</p><h2>Men’s Royal Rumble 2023 favourites</h2><p>The 2023 Royal Rumble has the potential to be one of the most star-studded in history. The rumoured return of The Rock will dominate headlines, with the Hollywood Star available at odds of 3/1 to win the event if he makes a return. The long-rumoured WrestleMania match between The Rock and the current WWE Universal Champion, Roman Reigns is the reason he will be the pick of many fans and bettors alike.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of potential showdowns with Roman Reigns, honorary Bloodline member, Sami Zayn, also finds himself at odds of 3/1. Zayn’s ongoing storyline with Reigns and the Usos will likely culminate in some sort of showdown on the Grandest Stage of them All, but will it be with the Champion?&nbsp;</p><p>The favourite for the event, however, is the returning Cody Rhodes. Rhodes has had a date with destiny since he stepped back into a WWE ring at last year’s WrestleMania. His ascension was somewhat delayed following a nasty injury at Hell in a Cell in June, but his return will be one of the most hotly anticipated moments of the night.&nbsp;</p><p>It feels like a foregone conclusion that Rhodes will be involved in the main event on one night of WrestleMania, the only question is how he gets there and who it is against. If a match between The Rock and Reigns is going to take place on one night, then it is plausible that they split the belts and allow Rhodes to compete in the main event on the other night.&nbsp;</p><p>If The Rock doesn’t return, then Cody Rhodes vs Roman Reigns feels like an obvious choice to main-event Mania Night Two, and Rhodes winning the Rumble is the quickest way to get there.&nbsp;</p><p>Rhodes has been given the Triple H 2002 treatment, with video packages of his recovery hyping his return. There are plenty who think this could be a red herring to play down talks of The Rock’s return, but the bookies currently think otherwise, with Rhodes sitting as low as 5/4 with some bookmakers.&nbsp;</p><p>As it stands, the rest of the men’s field is quite far off the pace, with Seth Rollins fourth favourite at 16/1. Previous winners Drew McIntyre and Brock Lesnar can both be found at 25/1, while Bobby Lashley is slightly more favoured at 20/1.&nbsp;</p><p>The Rumble is notoriously full of surprises though, and you can never rule out a late addition swooping in for the win. Randy Orton in 2017 is a great example of this, with the Viper not even being considered by bookies or fans until the day of the event itself.&nbsp;</p><h2>Women’s Royal Rumble 2023 favourites</h2><p>The women’s field feels a little clearer than the men’s, with Rhea Ripley being favoured as most people’s favourite. Ripley is on the run of her career as part of Judgment Day, and a dominant Royal Rumble win would set up a tantalising WrestleMania showdown with Bianca Belair. Belair has held the title since last year’s WrestleMania and Ripley is the perfect candidate to end that reign and usher in a new era of dominance on Monday nights.&nbsp;</p><p>Standing in her way, however, is the woman that Bianca Belair defeated for the title - Becky Lynch. Lynch won the Rumble in 2019 and is still one of the most over stars on the roster. The long-rumoured WrestleMania showdown with Ronda Rousey could still be on the cards if she can find a way to win here and Rousey can reclaim the Smackdown’s Women’s title in the next two months.&nbsp;</p><p>The rest of the women’s roster doesn’t come close to Lynch or Ripley in terms of odds. Bayley comes in at third at 10/1, though, another showdown with Bianca Belair is not likely to excite fans. Raquel Rodriguez and Alexa Bliss come in at 14/1 and 16/1 respectively. Both of these women have been in and out of the spotlight in recent months, with neither managing to sustain a solid push. Bliss is also facing Belair earlier in the night, and while Becky Lynch pulled double duty and won the Rumble in 2019, it doesn’t feel like Alexa has that kind of momentum.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/12/Talksport-Unibet-Review-1.jpg><h2>How to bet on the Royal Rumble</h2><p>Placing a bet on the winner of the men’s and women’s Royal Rumbles could not be easier.
